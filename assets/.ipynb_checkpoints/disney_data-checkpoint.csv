12,1bw8pro,Hulu integration?,Is there any way to turn this off? I was baby sitting my friend's child and opened up my Disney + to put a movie on for her and we were treated to this right on the opening page. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the splash screens to be family friendly on a Disney app. So far the only thing I can find is lowering the parental controls all the way down to avoid being offered Hulu content which also eliminates the things I DO want to see. Is my only other option cancelling Hulu? I like that I was able to keep family friendly content separate but I'm willing to sacrifice Hulu if that is the only way.,1712290139.0,https://i.redd.it/lvug69dp5lsc1.jpeg,0.44,5

Well NOW they changed it to ‚Äújunior mode‚Äù where they took away all the freaking Pixar movies and replaced it with shit like blippi and cocomelon! And tons of weird Disney shorts, tinker bell content, and Mickey content. Like no. I want long form Disney movies! Where‚Äôs lion king?? Where‚Äôs the little mermaid?? 

But then if you take it out of junior mode and set it to pg and below rated titles, they have all this adult stuff like dancing with the stars and ghost whisperer.

21,1bvgtg2,So when is Hulu fully integrating with Disney+ in international markets?,"So I live in Australia and foe just over 3 years now, we have had Star directly integrated into Disney+, which is the international branding for Hulu because Hulu only exists in the United States. It has pretty much all of the Hulu content on it and all of the movies and shows that Disney now owns from the Fox merger, with the exception of a few things. Some countries its called Star+ and in India, it's called Hotstar.

I am wondering though, since the logo/banner colour has officially been changed globally, is Hulu gonna replace Star here in Australia and the rest of the world too now that Disney owns 100% of Hulu?

TV-PG is used when there is ""infrequent coarse language, some sexual content, some suggestive dialogue, or moderate violence"". Anybody know which of these is now in this grade-school targeted show?

Hey so me and my mum are currently watching Criminal Minds together on her profile on our account. When we watch some episodes, it randomly puts us on the next episode infront eg if we watch episode 5, it will play episode 7 next time we load it up saying that we watched 6 when we didn‚Äôt. It also auto plays some episodes out of order occasionally. It also happens with other shows like when she tries to watch Jessica Jones. 

It only happens on her profile though which is odd. We have exactly the same settings on both of our profiles (both no passcode, 18+ categories, etc) but I‚Äôve never had an issue on my profile or when watching anything else and nobody else is logged in except us two.

Could it be an autoplay feature or something else? I don‚Äôt wanna delete her profile and make a new one since it would remove all watch history and continue watching and that‚Äôs unfair.

76,1bq93jt,Here's How Hulu On Disney+ Compares to STAR For Those That Want To Know.,"Hi everyone - I have access to both Disney Plus with Hulu and with STAR, and I know a lot of people are curious about how they match up. I will run down the biggest differences.



1. The streaming quality is worse on Disney+Hulu. D+H uses the Hulu rips of all content - they all playback at a lower bitrate than on STAR.     The biggest issue may also be a tech problem: many 1080p shows, that playback at 1080p on STAR and on the HULU app itself, only playback at 720p on Disney+Hulu. Shows like Abbott Elementary, American Dad, Bob's Burgers and most of the Anime, will only play at 720p on the D+H app, even though the Hulu app run them at Full HD with no problem.







2. There is far more content on Disney`+Hulu - this should just be a given. Hulu has licensed content from other studios that cover far more ground in terms of variety and genre than what's available on STAR. Hulu's library also evolves every month with content additions and removals. STAR has effectively slowed to a crawl when it comes to releasing content. STAR uploads a new original series to complement its pre-existing library but that's about it.







3. The home-screen UI is oddly better on D+H - The expanded content, Hulu updating their thumbnails, as well as deeper integration of Hulu content into the subsection categories actually makes the Home Screen more appealing and easier to find new content overall. D+STAR do not change their thumbnails or refreshe its library, this gives the impression that the Disney+STAR is just cycling through the exact same content it always had - an almost static experience.







4. The Collections and Genre section on Disney+Hulu are half-baked/broken - All of the Collections selections on D+Hulu use the same definitions (or metadata) they use on STAR - the problem with that is that a good number of Collections are filled only with the Disney produced content one would find on STAR, ignoring the additional licensed content from Hulu - this is evident in the INSPIRED BY BOOKS collection. Collections that do utilise the additional Hulu content do so poorly - often one long never-ending horizontal list at the bottom of the screen - The anime collection flat-out crashes on Apple TV.    The Genre section is has a massive problem too - THERE ARE NO ACTION MOVIES FROM HULU - D+Hulu uses the genre term 'Action and Adventure"", Hulu titles use ""Action"". The way D+Hulu recognises metadata means that it skips over all of Hulu's Action titles apart from one film - 1999's The Mummy.







Overall I don't think people with only STAR accounts should feel as if they are missing out. The additional content is fine but honestly I feel as if you could probably find most of it on your local versions of Netflix or Prime Video. Hulu on Disney Plus is closer to a neat little feature rather than the game-changer that I think it could've been. Frankly I could not tell you why they released it with some of the problems it currently has, but it is what it is.",1711665934.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1bq93jt/heres_how_hulu_on_disney_compares_to_star_for/,0.79,19

111,1bp9zp0,Word of warning if you use apple to sub,"UPDATE: Apple issued a refund this morning for the Hulu subscription. 


I use Apple to subscribe to Hulu and Disney+.  I chatted with support from DP to find out how to take advantage of the new bundle and was told to go into apple and cancel both subs and they would sub me to the bundle.  I did this and then the agent told me to just do it myself, subscribing to the bundle in the Apple app, while he waited on the chat.  I did so and was immediately charged for the DP duo premium bundle (what I wanted) and the Hulu premium (what I had just canceled).  Disney+ agent kept asking if I subscribed to the correct bundle, I did, and he said it did not add up...grrrr.  He finally acknowledged that I had somehow been charged for both and said I would have to go through Apple for a refund.  Now I am waiting for Apple to get back to me.

Is it an emergency?  No.  Is it annoying AF? Yes.  So just beware that when you sub to the bundle you may accidentally be charged for more than one app/sub if you use Apple.",1711566267.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1bp9zp0/word_of_warning_if_you_use_apple_to_sub/,0.43,5

125,1bom1xz,Is Baloo weak or strong?,"So, in the jungle book (1967), Baloo teaches Mowgli how to fight like a bear and Baloo does dodge most of Mowgli‚Äôs punches. But, when Baloo was fighting Shere Kahn, he could do barely anything and came so close to dying. Earlier in the movie, Baloo was yelling at the monkey‚Äôs when they stole Mowgli and he went through the whole process of saving Mowgli from them. Now, I understand that it probably is easy to retrieve a child stolen by monkey or two, but there were TONS of monkey‚Äôs, hundreds of thousands. Also, including King Louie, who is a full grown ORANGUTAN. Yet, Baloo can‚Äôt seem to defeat Shere Kahn. Now, you might think ‚ÄúWell, Shere Kahn is probably stronger than Baloo.‚Äù But, two things; One, Baloo fell off a 30-40ish foot tall cliff and didn‚Äôt get ANY scratches or bruises (Or, wasn‚Äôt screaming in pain). Two, Sloth Bears are able to defend themselves, and sometimes, even kill tigers if needed. Baloo is a FULL GROWN, Male Sloth Bear. So, was Baloo just not thinking, or is he truly just, weak?

188,1biw9ws,My honest review of Percy Jackson ,"My review of Percy Jackson, so far.

This is my opinion, but the show was just not good.

The pacing was all over the place , and it left me no room to process everything I saw. It was either way too fast or too slow. No balance, whatsoever. 

It should've been animated as everything about this show in live-action looked so dull and boring, along with how bad the green screen and special effects for the monsters.

If this was animated, at least it would've been more visually appealing and vibrant.

Despite how Rick wanted to aim it at a wider audience by making it live-action instead of animated to avoid the stigma of being a ""kids' cartoon"", I felt it was pointless because of how they changed so much from the book to make it as kid-friendly as possible by the hokey dialogue to how they made Gabe a stereotypical deadbeat dad who displays some kindness to Sally, even if that is not supposed to be that way in the books as he was an abusive jerk, thus making a show ""aimed at a wider audience that includes adults"" feel so sanitized and safe, in comparison to the source material

They also removed so much from the original book, so far, such as removing all the fun elements of the Lotus and the episode a chore to sit through and when it comes to Chiron, his actor just didn't look comfortable in his performance and a good chunk of the actors, especially Walker and Leah as Percy and Annabeth, respectively, were also not good as Walker was stiffer than a 2√ó4 and despite not showing up as much, Leah was flat and monotone as Annabeth (through no fault of their own, though).

If this was supposed to be an improvement over the movies, this was not it. 

It is honestly the most disappointing adaptation of Percy Jackson I've seen so far. 

It's not as awful as the movies but just disappointing as it could've been so much better.",1710884648.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1biw9ws/my_honest_review_of_percy_jackson/,0.37,5

192,1bhpg7e,"Disney/20th Century Fox should to bring back ""24"" for one final season.","So Disney has owned 20th Century Fox for about 5 years now and due to that, Disney now owns many of the most popular movie and television franchises of all time, alot of which are also streaming on Disney+ in international markets.

One of those shows is ""24"" starring Keifer Sutherland, one of the several dozen shows which I binged watched from start to finish during the COVID lockdowns.

If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it because it is one of the greatest shows of all time.

Sutherland plays a CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) Federal Agent named Jack Bauer who gets into all sorts of trouble with terrorists and the federal government all the time. That's the best way I can describe it.

The big selling point of the show though is that the entire thing take place in real time and over the course of one full day, meaning that each season has 24 episodes and each episode goes for one hour exactly (at least it did when it ran of cable television with the advertisements. When you stream it, each episode is only about 40 minutes or so, but you get the idea. The show plays out in real time). So if the first episode starts at 8am, the final episode will finish at 8am the following day. It had never been done before up until that point when it premiered in 2001 and I don't believe it has ever been done since.

Anyway, the series is just about to celebrate it's 24th anniversary next year of when the show first went to air and to celebrate that, I think that Disney should green light one final season of the show and bring Sutherland back into the role of Jack Bauer, especially since the last season that they did left thing very open ended with Bauer handing himself over to the Russian government. I think it would be great to see Bauer break free from Russian captivity and exact vengeance on the Russians for the crimes they committed against the American government in the last season.

Would you want to see this? Let me know what you think of the show down in the comments.

Oh and speaking of Keifer Sutherland, check out another great show that he made in the last few years called Designated Survivor. It's on Netflix.",1710764686.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1bhpg7e/disney20th_century_fox_should_to_bring_back_24/,1.0,0
193,1bh7dzq,Couple technical questions about the service's video and audio features,"Is Shogun available in 4K HDR?

I'm saving money to buy a really good 4K TV for my bedroom that I've been eyeing for some time. I'm not gonna watch Shogun for now regardless, as I don't have the time and there's a lot of other stuff in my queue. But I've been wondering if I should subscribe to D+ just to watch it (there's nothing else in D+ that I want to watch) when I have my new TV.  (Just from the trailers this show's visuals are amazing and worth the expense of subscribing for a month and maybe watching a couple animated movies) 

It's officially streaming on Disney+ in Brazil, but without subscribing immediately, I can't access their full catalog website and check if Shogun has 4K HDR available. So I need someone else's feedback. Is this show really good in the aforementioned settings compared to a normal quality stream, and are these settings available in Disney+'s plan? I've read that their one plan is universal and already has all the higher settings included, provided you have a fast enough internet and the proper device.


Some other thing I need to know about D+. This TV I'm gonna buy is gonna be my first with native Bluetooth audio parity, meaning I can just connect my wireless headphones without needing a third party device. I've never done this before in a TV, always done it on a laptop connected to a TV via HDMI. Are the quality and latency decent enough on Disney+ if you're listening via a Bluetooth headphone connected to the TV? Are there any issues, or does the app connects easily and without any downsides?

I don't really like to listen via TV speakers or sound system, and my living spaces are pretty packed anyway, so I hate my TV being loud, so I enjoy and prefer listening via headphones output",1710706570.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1bh7dzq/couple_technical_questions_about_the_services/,0.82,6

to allow access to individuals from outside their household will be able to add them to their

Recently it was announced that Star+ will cease operations in Brazil and Latin America and all their content will be moved to Disney+ in June 30 2024.

The recent FX TV show Shogun was added in both Disney+ and Star+, but they censored a nude scene from the 1st episode on Disney+ while kept intact on Star+.

I want to know if this happened in other countries from Latin America or just Brazil.

I know this may sound silly, but if Disney is ceasing operations on Star+ and moving their content to Disney+, is concerning when a show like Shogun gets censored, the same could happen to other mature projects going to Disney+.",1709472359.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1b5h4pk/disney_users_from_latin_america_is_this_happening/,0.92,7

334,1b0rvha,"Wall-E is such an amazing movie and it makes me miss the old Disney Pixar days - ""From Magic to Marketability: Nostalgia for the Golden Era of Disney and Pixar Animation""","Remember those evenings when Disney and Pixar animations were like a cinematic magic carpet ride? You'd settle in, and whether you were 8 or 80, you were in for a treat. Classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story"" weren't just animated movies; they were emotional rollercoasters with characters you laughed and cried with.

Pixar, with its ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Up,"" and ""Wall-E,"" felt like a pioneer in animation storytelling. They weren't just making movies; they were crafting experiences that stuck with you long after the credits rolled.

But lately, doesn't it feel like something's changed? Sure, there's been ""Frozen"" and ""Coco,"" but for every hit, there's a sense that Disney and Pixar might be leaning a bit too heavily on the sequels and franchises. It's like they discovered a formula that prints money and decided to stick with it rather than taking risks.

The heart and soul of those original narratives seem to be competing with established franchises for screen time. The question is, have we traded the depth of ""Beauty and the Beast"" for the marketability of the latest sequel?

It's not about longing for the past; it's about missing the feeling those movies gave us. The hope is that Disney and Pixar rediscover that spark, that dedication to originality and storytelling that made them animation powerhouses in the first place. What do you think? Do you miss the old Disney and Pixar magic as much as I do?",1708979496.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1b0rvha/walle_is_such_an_amazing_movie_and_it_makes_me/,0.84,6

344,1azrco1,What I want to see from Disney Plus,"**I feel Disney has kind of missed a huge opportunity with Disney Plus.  And in my vision for the app it would focus on the four pillars of the Disney business.**

* **Cinema Releases**
* **Catalog**
* **Vacations/Holidays**
* **Merchandise**

**\*\*\*For those who don't want to read all that, the abridged version\*\*\***

**Change profiles to have a themed specific landing page based on what you choose.  Add theme music through the app and little magical touches of animation to make browsing more interesting.**

**Let's add a cinema/coming soon section to the app.  Add Parks/cruises to the app.  Integrate Shop Disney into the app in a more strategic way.**

\*\*\*\*The longer version\*\*\*

So the first thing I would change is the landing page of the app.  We have profiles already and that gives us access to our individual wish list.  What if we could pick a main theme as our landing page, either:

* Classic Disney
* Pixar
* Star Wars
* Marvel
* Hulu
* etc

And based on our choice when we log in we get that themed landing page and focus.  So if you're a big Star Wars fan you don't need to a sea of listings thrown like spaghetti against the wall .

Also the landing pages would have magic to them, theme music, maybe some occasional animated stuff that happens.  This of course can be scaled back for low end devices.

Secondly I would integrate the four pillars of Disney into the app, starting with Cinema.

Cinema would be it's own section and would introduce splash pages, these are special full page sections that cover that film that is coming or currently in the cinema.  On this splash page would be interviews, trailers and other information regarding the film.  Also there would links to catalog titles related to the film.  This section could be a great way to advertise the film and instead of just using social media channels bring those videos to Disney Plus as well.  Also red carpet events, etc.  And when the film start selling tickets make a link that on smart devices allows you to purchase tickets straight from the app.  Are dumb devices like TV's use a QR code.

For certain big releases you could also do themed bundles of popcorn buckets or special drink cups and family tickets.  Key merchandise for the film can be featured and linked back to ShopDisney for purchase.  Disney has already started doing QR code links to ShopDisney for certain franchises on the app now.

in a world of paid streaming apps, I don't really see ads and have no idea when these films are coming out or existed at all.

Thirdly I would create a tab dedicated to the Disney Vacation Club.  This would have scripted and produced content around the theme parks and cruses.  Some of this content exists already on Disney Plus, but there could be so much more.  People love those shows around cruise ships, well Disney probably can produce some of those around their super expensive cruise lines.  They could also highlight some of the cool rides that you might not know about in the different regions.

Youtube is filled to the brim with content about the parks and I would imagine Disney would love to drive the narrative around them.

Fourth would be merchandising.  You just finished watching Moana 2 after it comes to Disney Plus and on the page you start the film there is a link to Moana 2 items on Shop Disney.  What about exclusive items or even discounts to Disney Plus members that drive more business towards the official store.

If you think how Disney does the parks, there is music, there is merch, there is a sense of wonder.  Disney plus can keep being Netflix or a DVD library, or it can become THE destination for all things Disney.  It can be the source for official information on upcoming releases, for merch and travel.

It worked. I am a bit confused because I made sure to buy the annual plan of Disney+ premium without the Hulu bundle, and I just double checked and there is no Hulu available.

When the crackdown goes into effect, there will be a new option to enter the zip code of your current residency to where Disney Plus will be used. Then Disney will ping to verify the IP is in the zip code stated in the account to allow access. I asked if that is the case, couldn't 2 people get into the same account as long as they are in the same zip code zone? I was told that is the biggest concern to which they are trying to figure out how to isolate that for 1 person use. 

However, I was assured that if I were to travel, I should be able to use Disney Plus anywhere I go since I am the main account holder and it should not be restricted to use only in my household. They could no answer how it would affect those using Disney Plus during say, a road trip since you are moving while on the service so there's a chance that Disney Plus might be disabled until you are stationary. 

IMO on this last part would be some kind of time limit said account could be accessible if a person is on the move. But yeah, this is the info I got so far. ",1707289559.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1akx5u3/information_for_those_that_have_disney_plus/,0.67,4

There is also a Hulu no ads for $18/month

Why on dis+ website can I order both hulu and dis+ with no ads for $20, but on Hulu website, Hulu no ads alone is $18, with no duo option?

I do see that I can add-on Dis+ (but with ads) for $2/month (regularly $8).

Do not go after anyone mentioned in my below anger. This was made out of frustration at the irresponsible changes made in the creation of this show.

I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt contain it anymore- I need to rant about this god-awful show. this show is hailed as being incredibly book accurate- but what does that mean? to the internet, which seems to mean half the lines are lifted from the book. to me, book accurate is not removing character motivation, character development, parts of the story, revealing the secret too early, and overall butchering the story into something that makes no sense. I believe the best kind of adaptation keeps the story and the plot points. Maybe swap some things around change some things, but overall keep things an adaptation. This show doesn‚Äôt do that. It removes scenes, rearranges them and removes key character flaws and features (talk more about that later). Anyway, let‚Äôs get on with it, starting with character designs;

Ares for one. WHERE THE HELL ARE HIS FIRE EYES???? his DEFINING characteristic, gone. or what about hades? he's meant to ooze power and malice. he's meant to be the first God like God Percy encounters, sat upon his throne surrounded by his minions. in the show, HE'S JUST A NORMAL GUY. that's the problem with this show. they've taken out all the awesome ideas and concepts from the book and thrown them away.

moving away from the designs, the pacing is SOOOOOO BAD. why was&gt;! echidna on the train? Why did they remove the best part of the amusement park- the cool trap Hephaestus set? WHY DID THEY MAKE IT SO THAT PERCY KNEW HE HAD THE MASTER BOLT, AND STILL WENT INTO THE CASTLE?? sure you could argue it was for his mum, and if this was the Percy at the beginning of the story I‚Äôd believe you, but this Percy would never be this stupid. they put in so many flashbacks but forgot all about Percy‚Äôs dreams until one specific moment where it doesn‚Äôt matter. the mystery in this is so forced, and Ares basically spoiled EVERYTHING about kronos being behind it all. no one mentioned kronos and then Ares started just telling Grover his whole motivation. also, I just want to reiterate- !&lt;ARES DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ARES. HADES DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HADES.

the underworld was my favourite part of the books. it was done so well and they shoehorned it into one single episode. episode 7 we're just at &gt;!crusty's for no reason, Percy already knows who he is, and for some reason he's guarding the underworld instead of Chiron. in the books, Percy runs into crusty's with the gang after running from some kids. Percy was smart and cunning- sweet talking his way into killing crusty and freeing his friends. he then finds the address he needed to go to, and then uses the skills he gained throughout his quest to convince Chiron to bring them to the underworld. in this shitty excuse for an adaptation, they just walk through the back door of crusty's and find themself on the river Stix. sorry, not river, it's just a field. and we briefly see Chiron. not the cool book Chiron, just the boring one from the mythology. then Cerberus shows up- he's meant to be the entrance to the fields of asphodel- he just runs up to the gang and we get a boring chase scene. we skip the judging, we skip the showing of the Elysium fields, WE LEAVE ANNABETH BEHIND??? no joke they invented some random reason to leave her behind for a good while. then we rush past the pit of Tartarus. no time for speculation of actual mystery building. we then go to hades' castle stuff happens there !&lt;and I turned off my tv because I was going to burst a blood vessel. this episode encapsulates everything I hate about this show.

Sorry for ranting but GOD. this show got my hopes up so high, only to produce a subpar piece of garbage that tricked everyone into thinking its good. don‚Äôt compare this to the old movies- anything can beat those. compare them to the books. This show can only be described, as slop. it is NOT faithful. it is NOT good. it is NOT what we deserved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: to everyone saying it's an adaptation and doesnt need to be the same you're not getting my argument. they removed important parts of the characters and rushed it. i get that not all adaptations need to be carbon copies, but when everyone is saying this show is super book accurate and its not i get pissed off. you can like it if you want but i wanted to rant about all the things they did wrong. like ares and hades. these guys are far inferior to their book counterparts. ares is just a guy on a bike. no menacing aura, no fire in his eyes, not godlike features. hades is wearing a silk gown and is just walkin around chatting. not what the god of the underworld should be like. adaptations should adapt i agree, but i am alowed to be angry when they're adapted in a way that makes them bad.",1706501150.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1adm5w4/ranting_about_the_new_percy_jackson_show/,0.35,38

Also is there any benefit I‚Äôd lose if I switch from subscribing separately vs bundling?

Long story short, I‚Äôve been subscribed to Hulu forever, got the D23 deal for Disney+, tried to hit play on opening day but because I already had Hulu with the same email it  somehow broke their computers (same thing happened when Disney bought go.com because I had an email with them. Every time Disney combines things to one account I know i‚Äôm in for a hard time). Fix was to have 2 separate accounts: 1 email for Hulu &amp; 1 for Disney+ to keep the D23 Deal I paid for. Never got any benefits (movie rewards, etc) of having Disney+ because it was a different email than my Disney account (same as Hulu).

525,1abg79c,Terrible UI rant,"Finally got disney+ after it has been recommended to me for so long.  
Because I am new to the service, I would have liked to be able to browse through everything to see what it has to offer, but no such option exists, only direct searching, and then the movie, series, and originals categories, both dividing their content into rows depending on genres and tags.

Now at least I can browse by genre or tag, right? NO!  
When clicking the view all button on a row, it takes me to a page that only loads the first 20 results.  
I tried restarting my browser and my PC, then decided I would try the app out.  
After battling to get the app from the microsoft store (needed to set my pc's region to US, despite that the service is available in my region, and so should the app).

The app looks and behaves exactly the same as the webapp on a browser, with the same limitation of only being able to see the first 20 results when clicking ""view all"".  
The only time when view all does not show 20 results, is when it shows less than 20 results (if there are less than 20 in total, such as for a ""new this week"" tag).

I will probably use some 3rd party site to see what disney+ has to offer me, since disney themselves are failing on that part.

527,19egsrw,Am I the only one who likes the Percy Jackson show?," I'm not saying it is perfect. The show has flaws and I hope Season 2 will try to fix some of the problems and have a different approach when adapting it. But, so far I think it is entertaining, and, although the events of the story play out differently, most of the characters are close enough to their book counterparts to think these are the characters from the book in different situations.

People are really, and I mean REALLY upset on the show to the point where I've seen people saying the movies are better and the show... That's right! The movie not even non-book readers hated was better, apparently.

But when I start reading a post from [r/PercyJacksonTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/PercyJacksonTV/), I see posts mentioning the EXACT same stuff as before (yet people upvote them a lot), and the post bounding itself on just one aspect. Like, you are saying the show is bad, but you mentioned just one thing you didn't like. And that's apparently enough to say the whole show is bad... Yeah, sure!

I mean, there were some complaints earlier, but I feel like the 6th episode (one that I also think wasn't that good) made people think this whole show is trash now. Like... common! The episode was just weak, not horrible, and now you think the whole show was bad at this point?

For me, the movie is gorgeous. One of the best Disney movies ever, in fact. I'd easily place it on the all time top 10.

634,193dhzu,Peter Johnson‚Äî Percy Jackson S1 E1,"I have read the whole series in middle school when my interest in Greek mythology was at its peak. I love Rick Riordan's works and is a fan. The movies were okay and maybe great if you have not read the novel. Nevertheless, I was glad to see some of my favorite scenes making it in but still hoped and waited for the series to see an elaborate adaptation of the novel. 

Just finished S1 E1 but few minutes in E2, I just have to pause it and breathe. I'm not a huge fan of sitting still and watching since I'm more of a reader but hey I have been waiting for this since middle school. Now that it's here, I have to watch it! I need to.

I know that a page for page adaptation is impossible and there will really be some changes in the script/dialogue but I wish they kinda stuck to the first few pages of the book. The stuff with Nancy Bobofit, Mrs. Dodds and the thing about half-bloods never getting past sixth. Ngl, it was rushed. Still, I'm looking forward to how the next episodes will be pulled off.

I just have one big complain that left a sour taste in my mouth. Maybe it's too early for me to say this but it's already ruining the series for me. Is it just me who thinks that the grown ups are terrible actors? I've read somewhere that the author's criteria in casting is more on acting or personality wise rather appearance wise. I don't know if Uncle Rick chose the casts but mannn they do not feel like the characters I have read. Maybe I just had too high expectations but I can't help it...

Sally, Percy's mother is so awkward? It felt like she was just reciting her script. She did not feel like the Sally in the novel
but is more of an older sister who raised his brother from a young age. Gabe... isn't his nickname smelly Gabe and a world-class jerk? But the him on E1 is just a manchild asking for peppers on his sandwich. Both versions of Gabe still annoys the crap out of me. Glad that did not change.

Same thing goes with Chiron who always has his hands on his vest who and Mr. D who looks like Mr. S for stoner instead. Grover... sighs. I like the Grover in the movie better. I don't know if having a child play a 24-year old character is better than having a young man Percy play the role of a kid. 

I should have set my expectations for the series low and I will for the rest of the series. For now, I'm putting off watching this series.",1704907100.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/193dhzu/peter_johnson_percy_jackson_s1_e1/,1.0,0

Over the past 2 days I keep getting one time passwords for Disney plus, I have been deleting them but on my actual Disney account loads of Portuguese profiles have been set up and they have been watching content, changing the language on my main profile. 

I have deleted them all, changed my password and logged out of all devices but I am continuously getting one time password emails and new profiles keep appearing. I keep deleting them but they keep getting added. 

I have changed my password and logged out of all devices about 4 times now, I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶.

I am also going to change my passwords on my email addresses too because I don‚Äôt know how they keep getting in, I don‚Äôt use the same password for different things so I‚Äôm confused.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks

Update 2: I thought it was over, but I have recieved more and more emails today, I have now reached out to Disney+ who said they will monitor my account for suspicious activity.. if it continues I will probably just cancel my account.

657,190jxlj,TikTok in the Mix weirdly censors itself despite being TV-MA,"It's pretty strange to see TikTok the Mix on Disney+ in the first place, but given how Disney is pushing music related content, it's not too surprising. They now allow TV-MA originals about music artists on Disney+ in America. And with Hulu now in Disney+ and Echo around the corner, it seems like new content on Disney+ won't be censored (Although older content like Adventures in Babysitting and Splash is still censored).

However, TikTok in the Mix has the word ""fuck"" uncensored whenever artists are rapping, but censored whenever people are just talking. Seeing how some of the songs are pretty inappropriate for kids anyway, as well as nudity being uncensored in the same program, it just seems bizarre and out of place to have all the ""fucks"" muted whenever beats aren't playing in the background.

It's also censored on Hulu. As far as I can tell, this wasn't aired on TV, so this version seemed to be made for Disney+/Hulu. Am I the only one that finds this selective censorship strange? I remember hearing certain cable shows are allowed to say ""fuck"" as many times as they want since it will be censored, but are limited to how many times they can say ""shit"" or other curse words that will eventually censor itself if it reaches a threshold.",1704602754.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/190jxlj/tiktok_in_the_mix_weirdly_censors_itself_despite/,0.69,7

You can't press it multiple times/queue it so if you want to go back a minute you have to press and wait 6 times, which takes about a minute and half, or attempt to click the right part of the progress bar, which is pointless because for a movie you can't make adjustments that small.

Nothing worth recapping happens in 10 secs - just make it a minute, or 30 seconds, or better yet make it a setting!

Disney Plus is so far behind the curve in this feature compared to any other streaming service. Feedback on the service does nothing.

Edit:  after some testing I found a sort of fix.  On Android if you are using the app directly it WILL stack rewinds to let you move back longer periods than 10 seconds but if you're connected to Chromecast (the only way I really use it) then you are limited to 10 seconds.  You have to disconnect the TV, rewind and then re-cast which is cumbersome but preferable to not having this ability.",1704310602.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/18xrvi2/bigger_segment_skip_please/,0.69,4

&amp;#x200B;

 

So, I‚Äôve been watching ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù on Disney+ (great show!) and came across something interesting in S2E6. The episode features dialogue in Mohawk, which is pretty unique. But there‚Äôs no English dub, just subtitles.

I think it‚Äôs cool that they‚Äôre including different languages and cultures. But as someone with ADHD and likely autism, dealing with subtitles can be a challenge. It‚Äôs tough when you can‚Äôt always keep your eyes on the screen, right?

I want to clarify that I have total respect for the Mohawk culture. My point is about accessibility. It would be awesome if Disney+ offered more language options, including dubs, for all their content. That way, everyone can enjoy the show in a way that works best for them.

What do you guys think?",1704071351.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/18vlpth/need_for_dub_options_in_what_if_s2e6/,0.39,6

I noticed however that in the beginning scene of season 1 episode 13, that whole parts of the scene are cut out, as well as certain sound effects missing. The joke of the scene is that the dog communicates with fart noises, however specifically some fart noises, as well as shots where fart noises are heard, are cut out.

I was mainly wondering why this would be. Do you guys suppose that fart noise sound effects have copy rights that Disney got in trouble with?

I have no particular issue with it but I'm mainly surprised by how much it changes up the scene, as it completely takes away some of the jokes.

744,18t8g1s,Remember 101 Dalmatian Street,"For context it‚Äôs an animated comedy series that is also a sequel to the original 101 Dalmatians focusing on those Dalmatians descendants in modern day

I quite enjoyed this series it‚Äôs not the greatest cartoon of all time but it‚Äôs fun with some good animation and enjoyable characters

The shows main duo is Dylan and Dolly and these two are probably my favorite part about the show as they have a fun odd couple dynamic Dylan being more organized and geeky while Dolly is more fun loving they can get on each other‚Äôs nerves due to their clashing personalities but are actually a very effective team when they work together

And since there are 101 Dalmatians in the show the writers take advantage giving a multitude of unique characters which I will list now

Dante-he is incredibly paranoid and afraid of everything he‚Äôs also black with white spots which is an interesting design

D.J.-the name says it all he‚Äôs a D.J.

Dimitri 1, 2 and 3-they all love to cause trouble

Dawkins-is probably the smartest pup and is Dylan‚Äôs sidekick mind you he doesn‚Äôt really like how Dylan treats him

Da Vinci-basically she is the artist of the group

Deepak-serves as the chill and relaxed pup who is also bizarrely obsessed with cats

Delgado-he‚Äôs in a dog wheelchair and has a pretty fun personality

Dizzy and Dee Dee-these two are very mischievous and are Dolly‚Äôs partners in crime

Diesel-not very smart and likes digging a lot well everyone has their hobbies

Destiny, Dallas and Deja Vu-these three are over the top divas and out of the three Deja Vu is probably my favorite as she‚Äôs silly and ditzy most of the time

Dorthy-she is the youngest that‚Äôs all I got",1703807501.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/18t8g1s/remember_101_dalmatian_street/,0.67,9

Sighs. I had to just turn it off with 30 minutes left.

None of these actors were good. Wendy was the only one with potential or carrying the film. 

I didn't understand the constant sword fighting, it was non stop. No other story, constant sword fighting, nothing else. 

The entire thing took place on the pirate ship practically. 

As an older millenial, the movie Hook was huge, huge. This was one the we did own the VHS. 

Dustin Hoffman just stole the show. He was great to watch. 

I have no idea WTF was wrong with any of these other characters. The empty plot. 

The main characters were all BS. 

I don't even know what this was. I'm just not tolerating BS shows anymore on these streaming services. If it isn't good, I'm just stopping them midway.

Last year we subscribed to Disney+ for the first time, right before they decided to introduce the subscriptions that include ads. We knew that the rate would be more this year, but weren‚Äôt expecting such a huge price jump ($79.99 vs. $139.99). 

Unfortunately, we forgot the date that we subscribed and would have needed to cancel. This week we were surprised to suddenly have a charge for the renewal on our banking statements. We never received any kind of email notice that the auto renewal date was coming up. Does Disney+ not send a notice when they‚Äôre about to charge your card for renewal, or did we just not get one?

Part of me is inclined to go ahead and hit the cancel button in order to avoid being charged for next year, but we don‚Äôt want to be out the money we just paid and without Disney+. If we go ahead and hit the ‚Äúcancel subscription‚Äú button, will we still be able to access Disney+ for the year that we just paid for (similar to how Apple TV+ functions)?

Disney has begun rolling out their beta integration of Hulu as a sixth hub in Disney+ for US users. This will allow subscribers of both Disney+ and Hulu to access most Hulu library content from within Disney+.

**How do I get Hulu in my Disney+**

You need to have an active subscription to both Disney+ and Hulu under the same email. This can either be via a bundle or two individual subscriptions.

**I have subscriptions to both, but don't see Hulu in my Disney+**

They are slowly rolling this out so it has not appeared to all users at this time. Also, ensure that both your Disney+ and Hulu subscription are under the same email address.

**Can I watch everything that was on Hulu from within Disney+?**

You can watch most shows and movies if they were part of the Hulu library. There are some exceptions due to streaming rights, which Disney is continuing to work on.

Premium content from add-ons (such as Max, Starz, etc.) is not available and will require use of the Hulu app or the premium service's native app with your Hulu credentials.

Live-TV content (including both live network channels and network on-demand content) is only available within the Hulu app.

**What if I have one subscription that is ad-free and one that is ad-supported? Do they both need to be the same**

The integration will work whether they are both the same (i.e. both ad-supported or ad-free) or if you have a mix.

If you have a mix, you will see ads based on the origin of the content (i.e. if you have ad-free Disney+, but ad-supported Hulu then Disney+ content will continue to stream ad-free while Hulu content will play with ads).

**Is this US only? Do I get this if I live in...**

Yes. Hulu is US only so this integration is only for US customers. Most countries with Disney+ have a Star hub that serves the same purpose.

**Do my watchlists and watch history carry over?**

Not at this time during the beta. However, Disney has confirmed they are working on that and expect those features to be part of the full launch in March 2024.

**More information and Disney's official announcement can be found here:**

I've recently been watching Amphibia and I got to Episode 9 where there is a character voiced by (*I think*) the same voice actor as Pleakley from Lilo and Stitch. I'm a pretty slow reader so when the credits rolled around I try to pause the show, but the UI just *completely* locks up. My laptop starts getting hot, fans spinning up like a jet engine, it like I'm trying to shove a wrench in the machine. I still don't have an answer because I can't get the UI to respond when I want it to.  


but this isn't the only time the UI has given me issues, even when its working ""normally."" As with all streaming services, at the end of a video it will minimise, bring up a splash screen with the options to exit to menu or view next episode/suggestion. You know when this is going to happen on the browser version because it completely locks up the UI, none of the buttons work, and everything is incredibly sluggish to respond. If you dare to click Next Episode after the splash screen comes up, you'll be thrown back to the main menu, and then be dragged into the next episode. I don't know why this happens because if you use the ""next episode"" button while the current episode is playing, it works just like any other streaming service, taking you straight to the video instead of taking you on a trip to the main menu and back.

927,187sgj7,Disenchanted (spoilers),"Just watched disenchanted. Thoughts (mostly in comparison to enchanted):

Positives:

‚Ä¢More scenes with Giselle and Pip together.

‚Ä¢Morgan getting a bigger role.

‚Ä¢Marginally a better setting if not for being more unique than NYC.

‚Ä¢A quicker start.

Negatives:

‚Ä¢Giselle‚Äôs plotline.

‚Ä¢Edward and Robert basically having no ‚Äòsignificant‚Äô / ‚Äòbig‚Äô roles.

‚Ä¢Far worse antagonists.

‚Ä¢Far worse comedy (mostly due to Edward and Nathaniel, the biggest sources of comedy in the original, being largely / fully cut respectively).

‚Ä¢Marginally worse songs.

‚Ä¢Marginally worse animation for the Andalasia scenes.

‚Ä¢Some continuity errors (one example - 54 minutes into the film, the time is revealed to be 2pm - 2 minutes 12 seconds (about) later, during the ‚ÄòPerfect‚Äô song, Morgan sings about it being a ‚ÄúPerfect Monrolasia *morning*‚Äù).

Overall rating - 6.99 / 10. I count 7/10 as being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and I think this movie *just* misses out on that due to too many errors. Sadly I doubt I‚Äôll watch this again despite it being enjoyable. I do however recommend it for anyone who watched enchanted.

For reference I‚Äôd rank enchanted as being 7.99 / 10. It‚Äôs only major weakness for me is a slow start. That‚Äôs the only thing that for me keeps it from being ‚Äòone of the (Disney) greats‚Äô.",1701376626.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/187sgj7/disenchanted_spoilers/,0.67,2

&gt;‚ÄúObviously, there‚Äôs a story there.  We‚Äôre in a wait-and-see pattern at this point. But I‚Äôm glad the conversation is about Ray and how great he was. I used to have mini debates with him and say, ‚ÄòRay, you‚Äôre the villain here.‚Äô And he‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äô I was like, ‚ÄòI know you don‚Äôt think so, but you are. I love that you‚Äôre playing it like you‚Äôre not.‚Äô Which is exactly the way Baylan thinks. I think he would‚Äôve been over the moon [on the fan reception]. The big regret here is that he didn‚Äôt get to experience that.‚Äù  

&gt;‚ÄúI think he would‚Äôve been over the moon. The big regret here is that he didn‚Äôt get to experience that. I‚Äôm glad he was at Star Wars Celebration with us, that he got to see the trailer and get a taste of that from the fans. And they‚Äôve been nothing but wonderful about Ray and the character.‚Äù 

Following Ray‚Äôs unexpected death, it has left the show with a question mark over the character‚Äôs future, as the show ended with the former Jedi standing on the ruins of an enormous sculpture of the Mortis gods, to which Dave also shared some thoughts over:

&gt;‚ÄúYou have to be careful with that. I know it‚Äôs a very specific group of people that would even know what those statues are, but I thought it was an exciting image, and it does give you the shape of what Baylan is after,‚Äù",1700823754.0,https://whatsondisneyplus.com/ahsoka-creator-dave-filoni-addresses-baylan-skolls-future/,0.96,18

965,182hppn,"Damn, I just finished Peter Pan and Wendy","And that was an underrated movie. They really took the original story and used it, exploring what it means to grow up and face fears of change, and ultimately, to accept them. It had the feel of a psychological study at times, and there was a surprising amount of depth. 

And man, I haven‚Äôt watched every adaptation out there, but Jude Law was by far the best Captain Hook out of all the portrayals I‚Äôve seen. His dynamic with Peter was so well-done, by both Law and Molony (an excellent actor in his own right), and the revelations when they came were truly heartbreaking.

I also loved the focus on supporting characters, especially Tiger Lily and a &gt;!genuinely ‚Äúmute‚Äù Tinker Bell!&lt; The cast as a whole performed beautifully and believably.

Anything documentary is usually interesting. I tend to like comedy like Fisk, Schitts Creek, Kim's Convenience, Bo Jack Horseman, Reservation Dogs, That Fool, and The Mindy Project, and Fargo.

Not a fan of Community or The Good Place. They were just not my cup of tea 

The last show that was allegedly comedy but more drama to me that I loved was The Bear. I don't care for crime drama most of the time.

The bundle from last year apparently didn't have the price for disney+ go up after a year, only hulu, so I assumed this would be the same since it doesn't have an expiration on the disney side. But when I finished my signup through disney+, it had me select my package and the $2.00 ad supported offer is only for 3 months. Does this mean that the offer didn't work, or is this intended? Hulu's offer says nothing about it only being for 3 months, and I can't find any other information on it.

EDIT: I signed up with an existing account (both hulu and disney had a previous account, same email) and it worked fine on hulu, showed the $0.99 plan and the $2 disney, and when I follow the link on [hulu.com](https://hulu.com) to login to disney, after login in it prompted me to setup my subscription. It showed the $2 plan, but said it was $2 for 3 months, and when I select that, it redirects me back to hulu where I can't do anything to complete the order (it's already completed on hulu's end, but disney doesn't seem to know that). I chatted with disney's support, and they had to open a case on it, they weren't able to fix it. They did assure me that the $2 disney is a year offer, not 3 months like disney's website said, and they put me on a month of disney premium to get the account active while they sort out the issue.

Neither one have been added onto Disney+ (despite the fact Professor Owl has slowly been given some merchandise attention) and neither one has been seen since their last DVD appearance in the Walt Disney Treasures Collection set *Rarities*), though if they were to be added, they may have to have content warnings (for ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"", for the occasional usage of racial stereotypes, and for ""Melody"", the same case for brief use).",1700499305.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/17zt0cp/should_disney_add_the_remaining_animated_shorts/,0.88,31
