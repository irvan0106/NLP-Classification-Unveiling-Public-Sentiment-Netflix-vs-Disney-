39,1bvhg4v,Homicide New York: Ep. 4 - Is it really what we think? ,"I just finished episode 4 of Homicide New York. I was really satisfied to know that Howard Pilmar’s killers were served justice and read as much into the case as I could online. As I read more, what really struck me was the fact that Howard and Ros son, Phillip, purposely did not want to be reunited with his grandfather (someone that was very active in his childhood) and advocated for his mother and uncle to be free. Why in the world would Phillip Pilmar, knowing what his mom and uncle did to his dad, fight for their freedom and continue to avoid his own grandfather after all these years? Then I thought about something wild.

What if Howard (may he rest in peace) and his father were the evil ones in this case? Howard and his father were extremely close. In the documentary, Howard’s father stated that Ros was Howard’s first everything. Ros was also apparently $160,000 in debt to her previous job. It’s stated that she hid this debt from her husband.. but you’re telling me, Howard Pilmar, the son of a business mogul, was completely unaware of his wife’s finances and past? His father was also unaware? Then she owes the government another $14,000 (unpaid taxes related to running one of Howard’s coffee bars btw) and the bill collectors were calling the Pilmar’s home nonstop in the days leading up to Howard’s murder. According to a NY Times article, “Mr. Pilmar had contacted a divorce lawyer and was looking for a way out of the marriage … Witnesses said Mrs. Pilmar had complained about her husband, calling him verbally abusive. And one staff member even recalls Howard calling his wife a c*nt among many other names.” 

In the Netflix episode, one of the employees stated that  Howard’s office was making $1,000,000 per month back in 1996… but they couldn’t pay off Ros’s debts? Something is fishy to me. The documentary said that their marriage was falling apart. Howard was known to be a flirt, but nothing more than that according to his women acquaintances.  Imagine a situation where Ros is very unhappy in the marriage, feeling abused and acting out. Howard and his father not only refuse to help her with her debts, but also threaten to separate her from their child Phillip and file for divorce, leaving her with nothing if she tries to do anything. Evan Wald, Ros’s brother, even stated that he would kill Howard if he ever hurt his sister in any way. This all seems like full motive for Ros to kill Howard (with the help of her brother) , take the money and Phillip and get as far away from Howard’s family as she can. She explained everything to Phillip as he grew up and now he wants no contact with his dad’s side of the family, only justice for his mom and uncle. 

Of course, all of this is speculation, but these circumstances crossed my mind. What do you all think?

56,1bv3e7b,Big plot holes? Travelers (Season 1),"&amp;#x200B;

Spoiler warning.

&amp;#x200B;

I got hooked on the series. I liked it a lot and I want to continue watching it but I feel that in episode 6 (Helios 685) there are some big holes in the script.

1. They show that in the facility where they are going to fire the laser, there is a toxic leak, and they must inject an anti-toxin if you don't die. But when the military arrives they did not have the anti-toxin and nothing happens to them. (Even the soldier who was already in the facility dies immediately) So what happened here?

2. They say that by protocol they cannot kill. But throughout the series we see that if they kill if something interferes with the mission. However, in this crucial mission, those who protect the facility do not shoot to kill. Strange

3. When the plan is about to be ruined since the military manages to enter and prevent the laser from being activated. (again the theme of killing). They are replacing people one by one. Considering that they are acting according to what happens in the future. Did you really notice that sending a single person was not effective and you are sending one at a time? really?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still hooked on the series and will continue watching it, but I'm worried about these types of script holes. What do you think, are they holes in the script? Do they still happen in the other seasons?",1712176294.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bv3e7b/big_plot_holes_travelers_season_1/,0.67

70,1bv5u7a,The Program rant: Katherine is annoying,"Before I start, a small disclaimer. I really think the program is fucked up and what these children went through is unacceptable. Somebody or multiple people should go to jail for this. I get how this trauma can ruin these development of children and has probably majorly affected her personality. I tried my best to empathize with her through every step. I don’t want to invalidate anything she went through, as the program truly was terrible. And lastly, I also don’t think Katherine is a bad person overall.



Having said that, I find the documentary maker Katherine Kubler very annoying. There were some earlier moments in episode 1 that gave me the ick, like her interrupting others to talk more about herself, but I let it slide because I was genuinely interested in the program. I made it through episode 2 and the way she was sending emails to her dad was so cringe. The meeting with her dad was the final drop in the bucket for me. It felt very performative, like she’s expecting to be praised by the internet for instantly filming and putting him on the spot like that. I don’t think there is anything the dad could have said or done that would satisfy her. She explains how parents are victims of the manipulation too, yet she holds such a grudge on her dad



Katherine is definitely a flawed person. She seems very unreasonable, vindictive, a little narcissistic, and dangerously obsessed about something that happened to her 20 years ago. It feels like she’s blaming everything that went wrong in her life on her dad and this 15 month period. I think the way she is dealing with her trauma is very unhealthy and stopping her from personal growth. The documentary has some other issues too, I don’t think I will make it through episode 3.

There are 3 teams each with a woman. None of the women in any of the teams didn’t get eliminated in the first round or even come close  to not getting eliminated 

Then I think back to the previous episodes 

Ep1 running.
Even the fastest girls rank 47 and 48 place(only 2 in the top 50) 

Ep4 maze quest 
We can clearly see 1 man can out carry, out run and out fill the bucket vs a woman 

Ep6 mine quest

This was by far one of the worse 
1 girl vs girl vs 1 guy pushing the filled buckets of sand to the destination. No surprised the guy won 

On the team event. There was a team with a guy and a girl. Girl only managed to pushed 5 bags leaving the rest of the 45 bags to the guy. If guy were to team with literally any other guy, I think he could have won 

Next monkey bar event. Girl didn’t even finished the event 

Ep2 arena 1 vs 1 combat. This was the only episode whereby 1 of the women beat a guy by grabbing hold of the ball for 5 mins 

1. Do they really think they can beat the men when it comes to physical? 

2. If you are a team leader, would you pick a woman as a teammate?

after fluffy popped up a bunch on my youtube feed i decided to get netflix just to watch mr. iglesias after i think 3ish years? and now that im sitting on a cliffhanger again im starting to get more and more annoyed that it was cancelled and never continued even tho the marketing for the show was nonexistent? like i found it originally thru a tiktok edit and no other content on it (even when i watched more tiktok content on it as a fan) and now that im rewatching it the advertising still seems weak to me, even the reason of cancellation and maybe this is just coming from me being petty but no chance that this show was done this dirty for what it was. im 17 years old now and im still emotionally attached to this show (probably just childish but it's something im really attached to, the characters are nicely well rounded, there was a story that was leading to graduation where the show was seemingly SUPPOSED to end.)  


so the real rant:   
mr. iglesias was a pretty good show but overall the part it was cancelled at was really depressing considering relationship building was building along with the age of the students and year (junior at the cut off of the show). just really unfortunate that the show ended there after like yeah there are still dumb things in the show like the laugh track being a bit excessive but it had a good base, no 10/10, but not something to look back on. the students had a good and clean relationship build up, the teachers had a nice thing going on, the chemistry was building over time, but it just cancelled with no return. really sad to me that this  show got booted off, fluffy had an amazing portrayal and the message that good teachers were someone to talk to and have a good relationship was interesting for me, i figured that i'd try talking to my teachers more often and i became hella close with my freshman year math teacher (me being a senior now) and i talk to her as if she's a good friend, she's my best friend when it comes for college questions blah blah blah. The point is that i miss this show, needed somewhere to rant about this show being gone and reliving the pain that it's still gone.

118,1btbxf7,3 Body Problem sci-fi nitpick review ,"5 stars
Have not read the books. 
I love space and sci-fi. 
I’m usually very nit-picky with hard science fiction. 

3 Body Problem has great writing and phenomenal acting. It’s the first media I’ve ever seen that portrays the Cultural Revolution in any way. I have no clue if they portrayed it accurately, but the scenes in that era were powerful. The casting in general is TERRIFIC. Seriously, all the actors seem perfect for their roles. I highly recommend this show. 

Multiculturalism: Unsurprisingly, as a westerner I have no problems with how the show portrayed different cultures. 
I don’t know how central China is to the original work, and I don’t know enough about Chinese culture to recognize what themes are missing from the series. I know eastern values are extremely intricate and integrated to the point that the show changing something as little as the number of wallfacers from 4 to 3 could change a LOT more than I might suspect. I would love to hear what things got lost in translation and what symbolism exists in the books that people like me just aren’t aware of. 

VFX: the show uses CGI as it should be used. Not just for explosions and spaceships but as a way of illustrating really interesting concepts. The visual effects are truly creative and downright cool. There are multiple truly iconic vfx scenes. 10/10 

Soundtrack: the main theme really captures the chaos and uncertainty of a three body system. Also iconic.  

Writing: legitimately good! even though sometimes it sounds like the dialogue was copy and pasted from game of thrones. The characters all have their own personalities and mannerisms and the story flows really smoothly. 

The Science: There’s actually tons of flaws from the lens of “what would actually happen.” But none of these flaws matter because the show isn’t going for realism. instead of world-building a perfectly consistent and functional alternate reality, it unfolds simple questions in satisfying ways. It’s like a fable. 

—————-!!!SPOILERS BELOW!!!—————
For example, the entire show could be summed up as: what if we contacted our nearest neighbor and they replied? Well, our nearest neighbor is a trinary star system so what would they be like? What if that world is so hostile and chaotic and interdependence is so necessary for survival that nothing on the planet ever evolved lying? How would a species that cannot lie react to us? Next, if our nearest neighbor replies to us, how common is life in universe? If life is common, why is everyone silent? 

criticizing the show for being unrealistic is like criticizing little red riding hood for having a talking wolf. Physical laws in the show are just story elements like the woodsman’s axe or the deep dark forest. They are ordinary while everything else is extraordinary. It’s a fable. 
So it doesn’t matter that the sophons don’t really make sense. Or that the trisolarans don’t continuously send newer fleets every few years. Or that Davos Seaworth just kind of becomes the ruler of the earth.  Or that a tidal syzygy would have just destroyed the planet before it pulled horses off it. 

Actual Critiques: 
Graphic violence: I’m the kind of person who is still disturbed by gruesome violence. They did a good job with the sequence on Judgement Day, and the gruesomeness was at least justified by the story. I just wish shows used more restraint. The most interesting parts of the scene were the least violent: like the paper dolls falling apart; or the child’s leg in the wreckage, or Auggies reaction to the live feed. These were just as *emotionally* powerful as they would have been without the *visceral* spectacle of a bunch of people turning to goo. We don’t have to see close ups of people getting stabbed or hitting their head on concrete or jumping to their deaths to feel strong emotional impacts.   
I would love to show my nephew the 3Body Problem because he’s into this kind of thing. But I won’t because it’s just too much. 

Graphic nudity?: not a critique. I’m super happy David Benioff and Weiss toned it down with the booooobs! The scenes with nudity were tasteful and legitimately added to the story. The rehydration scene was gorgeous. Props to the writers for improving since GoT. They’ve really matured!

Saul Derand: I’m pretty sick of the brilliant stoner trope. I’m just over it. I know people like that exist. I know a few personally. But it’s an annoying archetype. Hopefully this is part of the story arc for this character. Jovan Adeppo literally stole the show in every scene he’s in. He’s an incredible actor. I wish they had spent  more time on how he was reacting to the death of the science he dedicated his life to instead of him just being a stoner who’s smart… even though he’s high!
Most of the main characters dealt with substance abuse in the show, but Saul was the only one who had it presented as the character’s defining feature. Maybe it was because he was stressed and aimless, but the show didn’t do enough to present it this way. Which is why it’s one of my only 2* critiques for the entire show!

* Jin Cheng having her own plan explained to her multiple times by the knight of onions instead of the other way around made my brain melt. 3 critiques. 

Summary TLDR: —-SPOILERS STILL—-
A really good show with practically no flaws. The acting is astounding. Seriously, I have never seen such good casting. Rosalind Chao and Zine Tseng should win Oscars for their portrayal of Ye Winjie, one of the most interesting characters I’ve ever seen ever. Jess Hong is the main character and did a perfect job. Jovan Adeppo did such a good job I would instantly believe he really is a deeply emotional savant theoretical physicist in real life. Eiza Gonzalez, aside from being the most gorgeous human I’ve ever seen with my eyes, (even ahead of Saamer Usmani) was able to sell seeing a countdown in front of her, the dissolution of her company, her role in killing 1000 people, and her relationship with all the other characters while maintaining a level of competence AND vulnerability WITHOUT falling into the trap of Latina stereotypes HOW. Cómo lo hiciste? And Benedict Wong threaded the needle of compassion and calloused doggedness. The scenes with his son were truly exceptional. And lastly, I guess if anyone is gonna get cast as a crotchety know-it-all white guy puppet master who makes hard decisions I’ll only accept it if it’s Liam Cunningham. There were no bad or even average actors in the whole series. They all did amazing. 

Overall: Almost perfect show. The plot holes don’t count because it’s not really sci-fi, it’s a fable. The writing was annoyingly good, (I’m still bugged at the Davids for season 8) and the acting/casting was literally perfect. Visual effects were used in a creative way to illustrate concepts and not just create the same spectacle we’ve seen a million times. 
I don’t know how many uniquely Chinese ideas were lost in the show, but I will say it doesn’t feel like a normal western story. I’m a little worried that without Ye Winjie the center of gravity will move further westward and we’ll lose out on the uniquely Chinese perspectives vital to the original. I think this is a difficult task the writers have ahead of them. Good luck!

I watched a YouTube video sometime ago with some of the contestants on their personal channels doing an AMA,  and a small think that took the skins off for me,  was that they were never acutely allowed to sit and wait in that waiting room when 2 other contestants had a challenge.
When the cameras went off, everyone had to March to a large and cold cafeteria and it could be hours in that space til they’d go back to the waiting room set and continue filming as if they’d been comfortable.

It’s TV, it doesn’t matter, reality isn’t really reality.

I think it’s just the way they described it during the AMA,  how a few never even had a conversation with the judges etc.

Seasons 3-5  drag on a bit and lose some steam (what show doesn't?), but some episodes in those seasons, and the series ending, make up for it. By the way, the music soundtrack is incredible.

173,1brd1lo,comprehensive list of corrections to accuracy/inaccuracies in netflix historical reenactment documentaries?,"Are there any comprehensive or authoritative list of corrections to Netflix historical reenactment documentaries? Or is everything Netflix produces just worthless fiction that is utterly historically innacurate?

I actually enjoyed many of Netflix’s reenactment documentaries, like the lost kingdom of pirates, alexander, and the vlad the impaler show.

I’ve seen many complaints about innacuracies in these shows but I don’t know enough about these topics to know how good/bad the information is. I think some of the accuracy complaints on these shows is understandable (e.g., in these shows they often admit they will probably never really know what people were thinking at the time, and so ‘historians’ give their best guess about motivations to give some drama to the reenactments, and they made up a lot of the scenes and events… honestly i enjoy this as it brings history to life, as long as they identify where they are taking liberties, and clearly identify what is known from the historical record).

However, my heart sank when i tried to watch Ancient Apocalypse. Knowing a little more about these historic time periods, i was absolutely shocked at what utter nonsense that show was spewing. (Factually incorrect statements and counterfactual opinions right from the outset, utter nonsense building on top of utter nonsense that seemed to get worse and worse as each episode progressed. Apparently their “experts” are wannabe social media stars that anything but actual historians, or authors who wrote completely nonsense books.)

So now I am worried that all the shows are utter crap. Do i need to unlearn everything these Netflix shows have claimed? I am hoping these other shows have some sort of credibility.",1711787651.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1brd1lo/comprehensive_list_of_corrections_to/,0.44

177,1brdsq2,"Finally watched “leave the world behind”, few thoughts","For one, it is a little concerning seeing this type of content being put out just because in the past you had movies like contagion etc. that were all the rage and we all know what eventually came after that. A scenario like this sounds far scarier and I pray to the powers that be that this never happens here. 

The movie was pretty well made overall and I really liked how everyone came together as Americans regardless of skin color, race etc. We need to remember that we are all Americans and all want to live in this country for the same reasons, regardless of what walk of life we come from. This was a nation originally founded on freedom and ideals, it was never really intended to be a homogenous society. If this type of thing ever happened (probably not that likely realistically but with tensions the way they are right now globally you just never know, and the US is still a very formidable enemy overall but it seems like it is gradually getting relatively weaker), political unity would be absolutely crucial. 

One more point that quite surprised me was when Kevin Bacon/Danny mentioned it could be “the Koreans or the Chinese, one of them”. I believe this is the first time the Chinese have been labeled as a threat/enemy officially in American media (video games or movies) which is in sharp contrast to the usual “it’s always Russia” tone. Anyway, the movie had me glued to my seat the entire time albeit in somewhat of a frightening and suspenseful way.

It’s no longer a bleeding-edge feature for the riches (most brand-new TVs sold in 2023 had a 4K panel) so why is Netflix pretending it is ? If I want content with a resolution compatible with my 4K TV, I must pay the full-blown premium family plan at 19.99 for 6 different screens ! Even though it’s just me.

Of course, I can still get the mid-range plan but that’ll be 1080p everything. Except I did not get a 4K TV to stream 1080p content (a resolution introduced over 20 years ago).

So basically, to have the standard resolution of our time you must get premium. Standard will only get you *sub-standard* image quality.

192,1brb3so,Am I crazy how is Avatar watchable,"How. How. 

Like honestly. I have never ever seen a show where I’ve been legitimately bothered by how hair looked. pakku. yue. Zhao. first mate guy. Iroh. Ozais chin, buumi, mei, ti li, azula (also don’t mei and ti li have school what are they DOING)… every time there’s an extra who has normal looking hair or a normal looking beard I breathe a sigh of relief. It bothers me and it bothers me that it bothers me. There is no reason why I should notice this. Why. How did they mess this up? Am I just wigging out?

And this is the tiniest tip of the iceberg. I do like things. I like kyoshi. I love the costume and set designs. I think Zuko, Katara and Sokka do a great job acting. 

But the storytelling. The writing. The characters. It’s even cringier than the hair. 

Every episode Aang just has people lecturing him and he replies with, “but my friends” or “I’m just a kid who likes games,” or “I don’t want to let people down again.” 

I can’t even articulate. The show is just hard to watch tbh. They messed up bad. At least when freaking Shaymalan butchered it in 2009 he only tortured us for an hour and half. At least in 2009 we didn’t know shit about shit about representation. But it bugs me to no end that the only time I see people who are uniquely indigenous looking or uniquely Asian looking, they’re freaking extras! (Or ozai. Or Zuko.) wtf. 

UGGGHHHHHHHH this show is so bad!! wtf. I’m watching zhao kill the fish and holy crap this is garbage. A lot of the dialogue literally doesn’t even make sense. Thats it. I’m joining the dark side. I hate this so much. I hate this even more than I hate sand. But golly. So much effort went into making a turd. They need God and Metamucil for season 2. And wigs. And to actually edit chat-gpt’s writing. And use some wires ffs! Ugh. I’m done. 

If you love it.  Explain how. 
Oh!!! And the music!!!!!!!! It’s like they replaced every musical moment from the original with freaking unnecessary voiceovers!! Huughhh. Ok that’s it. Wild. 

Ok last last. The sad thing is there’s enough pieces and parts that are awesome that the show could have been good.  

They’re playing the apotheosis theme right now. It sounds great. But there’s no reason for it. You can have a great engine and high quality tires but if they arent connected to each other…

Oh yeah. lol. As a brown person I love it when shows show a bunch of dead characters who are generally browner than the not dead characters. Fun.

The cinematography is beautiful, the CGI is surprisingly good and while plot is a bit predictable, the characters ended up having more depth than I was anticipating.

227,1boj3my,Don’t be a foot note in someone else’s life ,"One Day is a show i’ll quite possibly recommend to everyone. I never thought I could feel so deeply for an actor and live vicariously through their mistakes and their desperate desire to do good but making things worse for themselves. Dexter is such a complicated, HUMAN  character who just like the rest of us is trying to figure himself and his life out and unfortunately in his case he is only able to find his happiness for a short lived time before being flung back into the same degeneracy he’d lived before. 

Something which bothered me about the show in the beginning was that they would set things up or drop important pieces of information that would at the time while watching the show (one or two a week in my case ((besides the last three)) would seem to just be loose ends and would quite frankly annoy me, my god how wrong I was. When Dexter and his mother had the “we need to have a talk” talk and the next episode aired I was thoroughly annoyed, but as soon as I saw that she had terminal cancer and the scenes which accompanied it I was HOOKED,  the show writers deserve to be applauded for building suspense and delayed gratification. 

The last episode dealing with the loss of Emma was deeply depressing but I can’t remember the last time I had felt so sad let alone for a goddamn tv character, but it put things in my own life with relationships and myself into perspective, and how anything can be unjustly whisked away at a moments notice and then you’re just forced to endure without that cornerstone of your life, and for that thought i’m very grateful. The last year, walking through and reminiscing the first moments with Emma was FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. 

The scene where Dex and Jazzy were climbing the hill paralleled with Emma is where I really started to get emotional. By god, the ending scene at the steps; the moment the montage began I started to ugly cry and did for a solid 30 minutes (I am a stereotypically “masculine” 19 year old boy) Thank you netflix for supporting talented writers and actors and for providing means for me to show a better side of myself to my girlfriend :)

There are sometimes some instructions as to how to switch to stereo, but when I try to follow them those options just do not exist. And I gather that even if you do manage to successfully switch it to stereo once, you need to do that separately for each thing you ever watch?

245,1boj0vs,Subtitles changed for Ready Set Love across viewing platforms/accounts?,"Recently, I was rewatching the Thai show Ready Set Love with a friend, when I realized that a lot of the subtitles were different than when I had first watched it. For example, a character went from saying he thought a girl was cute when she ate to saying that the donuts brought out her eyes. Or, a character said “This will be fun” instead of “Triple-whammy” in reference to her teammates. A lot of the changes seemed minor, but some of them changed the subtext a little, or just seemed random to change. Sometimes, they seemed less accurate too, as one line no longer referenced “ladies and gentlemen” when a character clearly states that term. 

After, I realized that this could possibly be due to me watching the first time on my computer and rewatching it on the tv. When I looked at the show on my computer again, the lines were the same as when I originally watched it. Another possibility is that the two devices are on two different accounts, causing the difference, although when I watched it on another friend’s computer, it was the same as my computer version.

250,1bnwn6g,Unpopular opinion- I thought 3 Body Problem was silly and contrived ,"I may be totally roasted to hell on this, but Im genuinely surprised at the almost universal approval Ive seen in reviews. Even with the widely-considered best and worst shows of all time, you’ll find a range of opinions, but I don’t think Ive found ANY negative reviews on this one.

FWIW, here’s why I did not like it (despite my high hopes and true love of sci-fi and fantasy):

The characters were underdeveloped and - to me - uninteresting, with the exception of Jin and maybe Dr. Ye. Many of them seemed intended to be “intense” but their emotional moments felt “unearned,” because you have to guess or assume their motives or base it one a short snip of dialogue.

Auggie - always pissed….why? Sir Davos - comes up with increasingly unhinged “spycraft/alien combat/religious cult infiltration/ rapid space innovation” plans…but how? I can suspend disbelief to a certain point, but even a CW show would give more insight into who this guy is and how he got to this point.

The dialogue was so full of “2024 speak” it distracted from the plot. Probably because most of the main characters are attractive young physicists all of whom are around the same age and happen to be best friends. 

Plot - rushed without time to think about why each plot point mattered. Also a bit contrived; did they really need that boat strategy when they could have just … boarded and taken what they needed? The ending wasunfulfilling. Even if you are aimng for a second season, it’s still important to give some sort of satisfying resolution to something (trying to avoid spoilers).

ETA - also - it seemed like a ton of the run of the mill earth shots still had very obviously CGI backgrounds, also distracting.

258,1bnxx93,Netflix App crashes my PC in a weird way,"It's the THIRD time it happens and I've never seen anything like it. Leaves me baffled. Here's what I've gathered:

1. It happens without fail every time the episode of what I'm watching (currently Shadow and Bone) reaches its latter half.
2. When it does, Netflix freezes and stops responding. In the task bar next to the Netflix icon a new, empty icon appears.
3. After this everything else freezes too. First the browser, then Discord, everything. It responds for like a second when you bring it to the foreground but after trying anything with it, it freezes. Except for some reason the WhatsApp desktop app, the task manager and the basic windows UI.
4. Trying to close the frozen apps ""works"" in that the windows close but their icons are still in the task bar and can still be clicked.
5. The PC is still responsive right up until the PC just blackscreens and boots up again though. I could after all type in the WhatsApp desktop app to some friends to try and get help (though the whole PC crashed shortly after that).
6. Upon opening the task manager (and this is the weirdest bit) the CPU, Disk and Network usage of EVERY SINGLE running process has dropped to 0%. Weird, because at least for the CPU indicator it still says it's running at another value (somewhere around 20% each time). Beyond that, all of them 0 except the RAM which still displays expected values.
7. Attempting to shut down or restart the PC normally does not work.
8. In the last two attempts I force shut down the PC by holding the power button. It started up again and there was no issue. I got back to watching, and everything was fine RIGHT up until the episode hits its last few minutes (say like, around its last 15 minutes) when the whole thing happens again the exact same way.
9. This latest occurrence I tried to do as much as possible on the PC before it shut down. Which it did. It just immediately black screened and then started again.

And as you can see, no. Turning it on and off again does not solve it. I'm completely baffled because this is the first time in my lifetime of spending almost every day on my PC that something so strangely specific happens to it. Anybody have any ideas on how to prevent it from happening? Or what could be the cause?",1711423618.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bnxx93/netflix_app_crashes_my_pc_in_a_weird_way/,0.75

And well, give me a Netflix marvel show over a Disney one ANY day of the week! They are by far better then what Disney has been able to dish out. 

Could it be that Disney is just too kid friendly on the superhero genre? Netflix had that grit, that bloody in your face action, with good story telling that kept me interested in what came next. 

Honestly people, I enjoy EVERY Netflix marvel show that came out especially when comparing it to Disney marvel  shows. Daredevil and punisher, alone blows anything Disney has made out of the water!

For Disney marvel.... It's almost a drag trying to watch the entire season just to keep up with the continuity of it all. Idk, Netflix just did it right man, it was a better quality product overall resulting in a much better viewing experience. 

So much so I just had to put this out there as I'm sure many have agreed with me on this. Man I miss Netflix marvel shows SO MUCH! they're so good man, we didn't know how good we had it 

Even when they were new I felt they got slept on by a lot of people, I was hoping for a defenders season 2 and beyond... But it never happened, then of course the whole thing got shut down and picked up by Disney... Daredevil reborn better be damn good, but at this point I'm not holding my breath for something special. 

What a travesty to marvel shows man... Real bummer!

We see that the writing on the transport containers is also in English - this makes sense as he specifies they were brought in from US.

Does anyone has suggestion to shows/movies in Netlfix similar to the ones shown above, which are basically some of my favourites ones. List, in order of preference but flexible:  
· Outlander  
· My Liberation Notes (Mr Gu and Mi Jeong specially)  
· Ask101 (Isik and Sinan dynamic)  
· The Wilds  
· The Holdovers  
· Anne with an e  
· Babylon Berlin  
· The Bear  
· Snowpiercer  
· Mixte 1963  
· My mad fat diary  
· Fleabag  
· Ridley Road  
· Better Days

I really enjoy well crafted stories focusing on human connections, intimacy, anything politics, and history. Also, any show that has a really well crafted plot that's also character focused beyond these genres, but that you can see having the same effect on the viewer as the ones I listed. Or regardless of genre as long as there's also a romance subplot that has a well crafted relationship where both the woman and man are characters on their own and not dumb it's so tiring. I die for romance subplots like alain and michelle in mixte 1963. In general, a political / historical / cultural drama that has an appreciation for the characters involved in the plot, in particular if there's a side well crafted romance but not necessarily.

I am okay with any language/country as seen in the list of some of my favourites I have watched Chinese, Turkish, Spanish, English, USA, Korean, Japanese, French, Austrian, Finnish, Chilean... so no worries on that as long as it's a good show I am happy to watch it!

I also don't mind they are niche, on the contrary is how I've often found my most favourites ones. I also don't mind if they're ongoing or unfinished (rest in power the wilds season 3)!

Feel free to comment known shows like bridgerton, shadow and bone, sandition, the society and so on, but I probably already know them --- so feel very welcome to also share more less mainstream ones! But if there's a mainstream one you think maybe fits DO share :)

Thank you very much any doubts let me know

280,1bnfpw1,RE: Homicide New York — something that has been bothering about most if not all of these Netflix true crime documentary series.,"I'm a longtime admirer of Dick Wolf's Law &amp; Order series, especially the early seasons of ""the Mothership,"" as insiders, including Wolf himself, often refer to the original L&amp;O. I tried to watch the new L&amp;O/Dick Wolf-inspired docuseries Homicide: New York, knowing I would probably get a lot out of it, but I was forced to give up after the first hour-long episode. This is something I have noticed on more and more Netflix documentaries of late: What is with this grubby, ratty, cheap and nasty non-stop non-music that plays through every frame of every single moment of every single scene of every single program? (It's called ""wall-to-wall"" in insider parlance.) Music is important to me — good music can be incalculably important in making a good program better. Just think of Mike Post's music for those original Law &amp; Orders. Not only was it subtle and affecting, even today, many years later — it's used sparingly. The so-called music used these days in documentary series like Homicide: New York is utter crap; it's garbage. If the material is strong enough to stand on its own, as much of the material in Homicide: New York is (think 60 Minutes, which uses no music at all), then surely it should be allowed to do just that — stand on its own. Worse even than the bad music, for me anyway, is the subtext of constantly using loud, overused, poorly conceived music that never, ever lets up, is this: It's basically telling the viewer, 'You're too dumb and stupid to get this on your own so we're going to shove you some really bad, forceful music down your ears to tell you how to feel, and when to feel it."" The music is not just bad: It's condescending and patronizing and frankly offensive. Scratch the record.

300,1bmvjxj,"""Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War"" is an OK entertainer and an awful documentary","I'm watching the second episode. My huge issue with this show is that it's not really a documentary, it's a collection of (really good) music, images and comments from different people, all pieced together in often mixed-up chronological order. It just feels like watching a one hour-long trailer that aims to encourage to watch the actual documentary. 

On top of that there are large gaps in the history (e.g. mentioning Stalin's purges, Holodomor, and then jumping straight to post WW2 period) and facts are very selectively picked making an impression that only the USA and the Soviet Union were the baddies. For example, mentioning a racial factor in US' attitude towards Japan in WW2, but ignoring the fact that the same was true the other way around.

Nevertheless, my biggest issue is the format of the show, and how everything is just pieced together. I doubt that I'll watch all episodes if it doesn't get any better.",1711314569.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bmvjxj/turning_point_the_bomb_and_the_cold_war_is_an_ok/,0.5

303,1bmh6g0,Problems with Black when watching Netflix over Browser on 4k TV,"Hey, maybe someone has an idea.

I have a new TV and i use it as TV as well as as my 2nd PC Display.  
When i watch netflix over SmartTV everything is fine, but when i watch Netflix over the browser when i use it as display, it has big problems showing black.  
Its very ""blocky"" and the only fix is to lower the brightness so much that its gone but then its to dark for me. Any other settings expect brightness has no effect, i cant disable HDR i can just switch modes of HDR.  
The problem isn't directly in the part of the tv display as i can move the browser and the blocks move with it.  
But on my PC Display its all fine, no blocks.  
I already changed my HDMI cable connecting my TV with my PC.  
The thing is, this is only with Netflix, i don't have any problems with black in games, videos or other streaming platforms so its so confusing to me.  
Does anyone has an idea OR even know if this is a problem that has a specific name ?  
With my eyes its just different shades of Black from hell grey to dark black the Photo shows red which i cant see in real.  
As example i use ""Blacklist, Season 9, Episode 1, Minute 04:30  
If anyone has any ideas it would help alot :)

304,1bn5r9c,"Looks Like The Show, Sounds Like The Show, But Doesn't Feel Like The Show","**Intro**

So I think I watched all of the ATLA episodes. This was before streaming was popular so it's very possible I missed it and I don't make it a habit to watch re-reuns. Same for LoK. When I heard about the live action, I was not excited, simply from what I have seen and heard about other live actions.

But I thought to myself, at least it will visibly look pleasant right? So this could be something I watch while I'm high. So that's what I did. TLDR I paid attention in I think the first 2 episodes, weed knocked me out until maybe the 6th or 7th episode. And then I saved the rest of it to watch it sober. Honestly I wasn't planning to from what I remember from the first 2 episodes, but I have thing about finishing...

**Love The Proper Representation**

I don't hate everything about the show. When I saw the trailer, I was excited to see Asians getting the proper representation we deserve and I was excited to get the the water tribe get properly represented. And I think it is a good sign to see studios willing to take this seriously. Movies and TV are a visual auditory medium for storytelling. So all of this matters.

**Some Good Here And There**

There are some good moments in this show. One of the Best comments on this thread already pointed it out. The 41st division's backstory. In the original, Zuko's unit saw a different side of him from the banishment story. But the one here was actually much better. Unless I am remembering the original wrong

I think the fight scene choreography was pretty decent and it visually looked great. Exactly what I wanted for a live action avatar show. It also seems like the show did a decent job at trying to be faithful to the original series from a story perspective.

**Pacing**

I know there are some complaints about pacing but there is a lot in ATLA and Netflix has very limited episodes in their series. There are pros and cons to this. On one hand, limits don't let it becomes something ridiculous like Naruto or One Piece. On the other hand, while ATLA could be slimmed down a bit, it isn't all that fatty with fillers. I wish Netflix has the option for series to have more episodes so that there can be more world building.

**Blue Spirit Switch Felt Forced**

And continuing from the last section, this is why I felt like that part with Aang and the Blue Spirit felt forced. It could also be because I missed 3-4 episodes while being knocked out on weed. But to me it did feel like Aang was too quick to see Zuko's side after he saved him from prison. It's not like their encounters were sparse, but it didn't feel like they have enough history for me to feel anything in those moments

**Younger Actors' Lacking In Performance**

I'm not the artsy type so I usually can't tell if an actor is actually bad or if they are just written/directed poorly. I can however say that is the case here. The actors that portrayed their characters well are Ozai, June, Zhao and Iroh. I thought for the most part the actors did a really good job portraying these characters. I will talk about my misgivings to Iroh but he is tougher to play than the other 4 simply because there is just more to him and he gets more screen time so there is more to pick on.

I would say Pakku was pretty alite as well but being angry and stubborn was his character so it was easy since it was so shallow. Sokka did all right as well. Not amazing, but all right. Like Sokka in the show, he has some serious moments and comedic moments. But the former ends up taking center stage more with the latter sometimes missing. And I think it has to do with the show focusing on a more serious tone due to the lack of episodes

Characters who I thought was done poorly was Aang, Katara, Azula, Mai and Ty Lee. A lot of times when I was watching their scenes, it was like I was looking at cardboard. The actors can say the lines and try to emulate the proper emotions with their face, but the rest of their body language just simply didn't sync up with that. And I think the director knows this as well which is why there are so many stand-still cinematic shots centered on the character when they monologue. Because when they don't do that, you noticed this flaw a lot more.

The only thing I can attribute this to is them being younger actors. They are less skilled than their more seasoned casts. And it is very noticeable in this show. And I will discuss why I think that is the case in this show. But I don't think it's a case where actors are bad simply because they are young. There are shows/movies where kids CAN play their role well. Stranger Things is a great example of that even at their youngest age in the first season. Nothing is stiff and everything is very fluid and dynamic.

**Iroh Could Be More Calm**

This one will be short. I think the actor, did a pretty good job with Iroh. And I could be measuring this all wrong because I was knocked out for part of it. But recently Youtube has been advertising some clips of ATLA to me. And LoK as well.

With the Iroh scenes we get in the live action show, the actor did a good job at showing that empathetic side and the wise sage. But there is also a calmness and levity to Iroh that isn't shown in this show. Instead he is almost always serious. So I don't know if this is the actor's fault or if it's the director's fault. Because as I've mentioned in the above, it seemed like the comedic tone of this show was only sprinkled in here and there.

**Visual Accuracy Matters Because It Is A Visual Medium**

Everyone has talked about this to death but yea Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are kind of a bit chubby. I don't think Katara should get as much hate though. She may not be perfectly accurate to ATLA but I don't think she was too far off either.

I don't recall if this was a Youtuber or someone else, but they mentioned that it could be the fault of the people who made the wigs. Could totally be possible.

But one thing I hate about this discussion is people who make points about ""how it doesn't change the story"". A show is a visual auditory medium for storytelling. The VISUALS MATTER. So yea I was very thrown off by how those 3 looked and very confused why those specific actors were chosen. Because as I've mentioned before, they aren't very good actors to begin with. So they are taking Ls in both the visual representation and the acting department.

**Asians Still Suffering From STEM focus**

As mentioned in the above, I've given the younger actors quite a bit of shit specifically about Azula, Ty Lee, Mai and Aang. And I'm going to have to put this one on my community.

Historically our parents have always pushed us into STEM and not so much the arts. And I think as a result, the pool for Asian representation, while not empty is smaller. And look, not everyone is going to be a winner. Not everyone is going to be a Steven Yeun, Michelle Yeoh, Ali Wong or Simu Liu. But we increase the chances of that if there are more Asian Americans that engages in a career in the arts.

I've noticed that Millennial and Gen-X parents in my community are steering away from that ""must be STEM"" notion a lot more. But not entirely. So I hope that improves in the future.

**Looks Like The Show, Sounds Like The Show, But Doesn't Feel Like The Show**

So I think the show was a bit too focused on hitting the story plots they wanted to hit and create a spectacle. Which btw, they should. However ATLA wasn't great simply because of those things. It wasn't just cool because superpowers are amazing. It's not just cool because it has a good storyline. But it was enjoyable to watch because, for a lack of a better term, it has this Disney element to it. Side note, not a huge fan of Disney.

But what I mean is this, if you watch a lot of modern Disney movies and this is very well showcased in the Marvel ones, they interleave comedic relief with serious/dramatic moments and intense/engaging actions scenes. ATLA did that as well and it did it really well. One of the biggest problems with this show is that the comedic part was largely gone. There were a few quips and there but not much. There are moments they try to sprinkle that in but the execution was just not there. And it just simply wasn't wacky enough. I think ATLA could of really worked with a tone like Guardians of the Galaxy. I think that would of fit this very well.

But because they didn't do this, it didn't feel like an Avatar show and ended up feeling like someone's edgy side project.",1711343352.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bn5r9c/looks_like_the_show_sounds_like_the_show_but/,0.32

319,1bmdlyu,Similar shows,"Hear me out. There are similarities between two shows that are abstract in nature. One is the comedy ""The Vince Staples Show"" and the other is the dark violent comedy ""The Gentleman""  The main reason is the lead character is the same. Person who is well known  and well liked. They both slow walk through life reacting in a non-plussed manner. Uses their position to help others and help themselves. This creates a calm/storm situation. It's foreshadowed in ""The Gentleman"" with zoo/jungle comparision. The chaos creates the funny situations which pop up frequently and unexpectedly.

You can find more similarities with the relationship dynamics with the family members and ""co-workers"" 

Both shows are worth watching. Guy Ritchie is mostly good. There is the first season of ""The Gentleman"" made a few years ago but I like the second season better. The Vince Staples Show is much lighter and has more frequent  jokes. I hope Vince Staples, his writer, Winter Coleman and director William Stefan Smith continue to trust their instincts and continue to make more shows.

1. I haven’t read the books so I am judging it solely as a stand alone entity.

2. I have only binged up until the end of episode 5.

All-in-all I think that it is awesome.

I know that The Onion review was whinging about Netflix releasing it all at once to be binged but holy shit am I glad that they did. I wanted to watch a quick episode before bed and the next thing I knew it was 3:30am.

Personally, I think it is the best sf show on TV since The Expanse - these shows just demonstrate the dire state of TV writing these days.

Two of the best aspects of the writing to me are:

1. The story is hard sf. There are some pretty advanced scientific concepts being thrown around. While I am very much a layman the cosmological science stuff is explained in a way that just makes intuitive sense. I have a very limited understanding of quantum physics and multiple dimensions but the episode where those were explained caused me to go “of course!” instead of “What the fuck are they on about?”.

2. I know that this is going to lose 75% of the people reading this but I am one of those troglodytes who gets cranky at the overly-PC inclusion for the sake of inclusion bullshit that has lead to paper shallow check box diversity, Mary Sue’s and absolute enshittification of a lot of recent media. But this show is incredibly diverse and while the first episode has a few moments it all very quickly starts feeling organic, and the writing in general serves the backgrounds of the characters and it just feels natural. (Another show that did diversity incredibly well was Sense 8 which treated gender identity and themes around it in an incredibly mature way that made sense in the story it was telling.)

So yeah.

I'm not interested in what shows are coming in the future, I'd like to know what shows I can watch at this very moment. I can't see it anywhere on Netflix's official website.

If I choose the 'premium plan', aka the most expensive one, will I still be getting ads? Like, will I get ads while I'm watching something? Last thing I want is be interrupted by ads in the middle of a TV show session. I'd watch cable TV if I wanted that.

Where can I see what dubs are available for TV shows? Example: can I watch Sopranos or Breaking Bad in different languages?

340,1bl8cd1,Haunted is pretty good but are these horror stories really based on true events?,"I just binge-watched all three seasons of “Haunted” on Netflix and overall, it was a pretty good time for the most part. Most of the horror stories are unique, scary, twisted, and pretty creepy. I loved the diversity of episodes here since it has a bit of everything for different kinds of horror fans.  
  
Whether you love demons, ghosts, murderers, or witches, I felt this hit all sorts of horror tropes that are popular in the community. The only thing is that some episodes were better than others and some felt like complete fillers that weren’t all that scary.  
  
I also question if these are all “true stories” since they don’t show any actual photographs or videos of all these horrific encounters as it’s mostly shared in a roundtable format as stories. When I researched this show, a lot of sites claimed that none of these stories are real and are just horror stories shared by the real people who lived it. Take it for what you will but as a whole, this was still fun to enjoy.   
  
I was curious and looked up a few episodes to see if they were real and yeah some were, but some couldn’t be verified. Either way, hands down the best episode for me was “Ward of Evil” in Season 2. That episode was genuinely creepy as all hell and worth watching twice. If you love “The Exorcist” this one will likely blow your mind and again, if it is indeed true, that just adds another reason this show is worth watching.  
  
I give “Haunted” on Netflix a 3/5 since it’s good but not anything extraordinary. It wasn’t terrible or anything as there are a bunch of hidden horror gems here with “Ward of Evil” leading the way. Don’t be surprised if some just feel a little bit too unrealistic as chances are it’s probably not real but some of these stories did indeed happen so if anything, it leaves a nice mystique around this whole show. I also see they have “Haunted: Latin America” which intrigues me to follow up on this show since I’m curious how that one is since I’m half Cuban and half Puerto Rican.

343,1bl1gd1,Unrelated device in house was connected to a friend’s Netflix account and I’m ignorant as to how ,"a friend was over and signed into their Netflix account via my Xbox app (Xbox signed into my personal accounts/emails, TV signed into my personal account). We chose the “I’m traveling option”. So we watch a few comedians on Netflix and call it a night, I sign out, turn everything off. at no point did we sign in or watch anywhere else. 

Now a few days later I’m in a different part of the house watching  a different TV with my grandpa (TV and his Google Cast signed into his personal emails and accounts, none of which connected to my emails/accounts or friends info). His google cast homepage is suggesting we continue watching the comedians the friend and I watched days ago. I go to his Netflix app and instead of his account, it’s my friend’s account signed in and accessible. 

Can someone explain how/why this happened? The only thing in common between the two is the internet connection. Does that override other logins connected to the same internet? What’s odd though, is other devices weren’t signed into the friend’s Netflix and remained unchanged. So only my grandpas Google Cast on his tv (not even the tv app itself), and intentionally my Xbox temporarily.

Laios: 

Why do you go through all this trouble to live down here (the dungeon).

No offense but life is easier up top (in the upper world).

&amp;#x200B;

Senshi:

If I live up there, who would keep the bathrooms cleaned and stocked.

If a zombie got stuck in a toilet, who would pull them out.

Who would fix the golums if they fall apart.

If the Golems are gone, the monsters from the lower floors would come to the upper and other would do the same.

If that is done, who knows where the monsters would eventually end up coming (to the upper world).

If that happens this place will change in a bad way, you wont be able to hunt or walk around.

Dungeon is like a field, if you dont care for it right, you cant enjoy what is brings you.

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking is, in here I eat what I grow and hunt but I always give something back to it

Living like that makes me appreciate the dungeon, makes me feel like that when I step foot in here, I am a part of it all,

\*and that makes me happy\*.

Worked yesterday (Europe/Germany).","Logout/login, app cache reset, firmware update, full factory reset didn't help. Every 10th error randomly changes ""The title you've requested is no longer available on Netflix"".

Right around the second try of about 50, but before all the stuff mentioned above, one series started to play shortly until I changed to make an A/B test. Other than that, no success and those two messages switching in a 9:1 ratio.

Netflix works on the mobile app. Internet obviously works.

Some numbers on disruption sites aren't clear about it.

Don't have the nerve for some random planned obsolescence bs.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. The post got heavily downvoted. Funny bunch.

Edit: Netflix support says it is due to licenses with Samsung, simulatenously admitting the hardware is perfectly capable, which we all knew already. Now to me this screams like (indirect) planned obsolescence. And on a side note, this problem of artificially dumbing down perfectly capable hardware has been going on for quite some time without consequences in many areas of tech. Another prime example are subscription based car seat heaters and so on. It is disgusting. Now in this case, the culprit could be Samsung, Netflix or both. Just recently there were news of Samsung dumbing down watches-hardware. It seems institutions responsible for taking action against this kind of business behavior are sleeping.",1710966014.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bjnagk/anybody_got_hit_with_netflix_is_no_longer/,0.81

396,1bjg37l,Obsessed with Avatar The Last Airbender Live Action ,"So I watched this show a month ago and I'm obsessed. Doesn't help that the cast interviews are also charming as hell. Then I joined the Avatar subs and the negativity over there is just stifling so Imma post my thoughts here. 

No Jennifer some of us genuinely love this show and are excited to see more. I loved Zuko and his story. Sumn about him gave me Vegeta vibes and I'm here for it. I loved Sokka and his weirdly stupid jokes that still show how intelligent he is even while being stupid as heck.

I loved Ozai and how manipulative and cold he is.Doesnt hurt that he's very hot though. Always loved my evil men ripped . Hope Iroh beats his ass next season though cause what a terrible father.

I loved Azula and the way you can see she's bloodthirsty and just full on not right in the head especially when it comes to her brother. I can't wait for their battle for the throne cause with that lightning and Zuko's martial arts, it's gonna be some sweet fight .

I adored Zhao and his melodramatics. And god darm is that Avatar with the bear skin at the end hot asf (I forgot his name) but that's daddy. 

And lastly I love little cutie pattotie Aang even when his reluctance to be the Avatar was getting a little repetitive to listen to. Hope next season they don't repeat this plot cause it gold old fast. However his powers are just the coolest and everytime he'd Avatar state thing I was hype. 

So yes people some of us truly do love this show and are truly awaiting the next season. And if you wanna try this show, I highly recommend. 10/10 in my books. ",1710948265.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bjg37l/obsessed_with_avatar_the_last_airbender_live/,0.53

I’ll go first. Here are four good ones I’ve seen in the last few years (some newer and some older):

Genre: fantasy
Show: The Sandman
Description: Based on Neil Gaiman’s book series, this show follows Dream, also known as Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, as he navigates various realms and encounters powerful beings.

Genre: adult animation/dark comedy
Show: Bojack Horseman 
Description: This show dives into the darkly comedic and introspective journey of a washed-up anthropomorphic horse actor navigating life, relationships, and his inner demons in Hollywood.

Genre: animation/action/drama
Show: Blue Eye Samurai
Description: This show follows around a skilled assassin seeking justice and uncovering dark secrets from her past.

Genre: action/drama/sci-fi
Show: 3%
Description: This show is a dystopian series where individuals (97% of the population) compete for a chance at a better life in a divided society (the 3%).

408,1bj1uso,"Finally saw X and WOW, that one particular scene was such an iconic horror moment","“X” gave me major “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” vibes right off the bat which was a nice homage to a horror classic. This is one of those movies that if you enjoy a slow burn and tension build-up, it’s for you. The only big issue I had was this all felt a bit unrealistic with antagonists that weren’t all that believable.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the creativity here as that was refreshing but I expected something else due to all the hype this horror movie got. I will say though, besides that, I will never be able to listen to “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper” ever again without remembering that ONE SCENE from “X”. 

Don’t worry, I won’t spoil it for you but many years from now, it’ll be remembered as an iconic horror moment in movies because it was so wild, creepy, and bloody fantastic all while that song was playing. It was so damn awesome!

This was a fun slasher movie with some parts that dragged on with an okay ending but overall, it’s worth watching since it’s the start of a new horror franchise. All the gore, special effects, and killer soundtrack made this a 4/5 for me and it’s worth watching on Netflix. “X” has a solid cast and a unique story to make this a memorable slasher flick.",1710898920.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bj1uso/finally_saw_x_and_wow_that_one_particular_scene/,0.59

416,1biy62p,Spaceman: regarding Lenka ,"I’m sorry if this is the incorrect place to post this. I just have a question pertaining to the movie “Spaceman” regarding Lenka (character that plays Adam Sandlers wife)

I loved this movie but the scenes with Lenka really pissed me off. Is the movie trying to cultivate these feelings of anger towards her??? Or is the movie trying to get us to sympathize with her??

It seems Jakub is arguably on the most important mission of all time. Very important for all of humanity. With that being said it seems Lenka is only thinking about herself! She has every right to fall out of love with Jakub but BY GOD while he is up there anyone with a modicum of sympathy would fake being in love with him to keep his morale high. At least until he successfully back in earth. It’s my understanding the whole journey is less than two years? This isn’t about her. This isn’t about Jakub. It’s about progressing humanity.  Oh poor Lenka! Her husband left her to go on an hugely important mission! You know what she should do? Dump him. Yeah dump him while he is trying to not die and maintain his sanity! 

It just seems the movie is trying to teach us that it’s not just the people who go away on journeys, war ect. that suffer the most. The loved ones back home suffer equally. This sentiment is just simply not true whatsoever at least in this case! I do not feel bad for Lenka one iota in fact, I actively hate her.

How can a story this basic, Predictable and doddering ever work? Just coz it stars MBB doesn't mean it will sell. I agree she has the star power but you simply cannot fool the audience with crappy plot.

Nothing has worked in this movie. CGI was mediocre, Most of the time all MBB did was scream, shallow content, all other characters were just existing.

After watching this movie i realized that Netflix has been nothing but Disappointing when it comes to movies.

I very rarely get emotional especially watching TV/movies but there was a specific quote where one guy says, ""Its 2022. We were supposed to be flying to Mars, not seeing people being executed Nazi-Style."" And while yes I agree some parts of the show may exaggerate or leave convenient details out I think that this series especially the last episode shows how violent, and terrible people are to each other. As I mentioned before I usually try to not be emotional but this series shows such a wide array of conflict and war, where it just makes me wonder what it would take or what it would be like if people could stop torturing, killing, raping ECT. Im not just talking about the Russia/Ukraine war but conflicts world wide. I know it's a ""Everything is rainbows and Unicorns"" dream, but... damn. And if Nuclear war happens? Smh. Can we just fucking stop killing each other? Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that likely anytime soon. I've seen so much violence on screen and in real life and after a certain amount of years you just get exhausted seeing so much violence. Anyways rant over, if you haven't seen the show I would recommend watching it. In my opinion episodes 3 &amp; 4 are a little repetitive so if it gets to boring for you skip ahead a little, I think episode 9 is the most emotionaly impactful.

What I've been trying to find is whether there's an issue tracker item somewhere, or a petition, or anything I could add my voice to, to express our displeasure at:

1. this basic feature lacking, which \_every single\_ other service offers at any tier.
2. in particular, it not being made clear when Netflix compares the plan options, that this is a distinct and intentional drawback of the plan with ads.

Naturally, we're free to pay for an ad-free plan, or to quit using Netflix entirely. Both tempt me.  
What I'm mostly sore about is #2 above -- since we weren't able to make an informed decision when electing whether to shift to an additional slot on another account, vs. jumping to an ad-supported plan.

We were even duped into buying an additional Chromecast with Google TV, thinking it would allow casting since various places claimed this is what you needed to work with the ad-supported plan -- how irritating to discover that what was meant by this is that you can use the app on the Chromecast, with a remote.",1710741752.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bhjs86/anywhere_useful_to_complain_about_ad_plan/,0.57

The casting is absolutely perfect, and I can't single out any one actor over that of another, because they truly all do such a fantastic job. If I had to, Kaya Scodelario and Daniel Ings totally crushed their roles.


The cinematography is top notch and beautifully well-done, and the humor and story progression are classic Guy Ritchie. I really love the fact that he's able to stretch out his usual rapid paced storytelling.


 Moreover, this is the first show in a very long time that I've actually had fun watching. It's genuinely engaging and hilarious. Episode 5 was my favorite, a massive throwback to his 2000 film Snatch (one of my favorite movies ever).

Since I got my account back I’ve watched: Alone, Post Card Killings, I See you, the Abyss, and The platform. They all have unclear endings. I tried to watch: Fool Me Once, One Day, The Fall of Usher, The Gentlemen and I just can’t get into it. It seems as though none of the storylines begin to make sense till the last 2 episodes. I’m also tired of the English accents, and comedic-gangster juxtapositions. I loved money heist but not interested in rewinding the storyline to watch Berlin. I loved the Painkillers series and Hunger. I wanted an adult animation to replace Disenchantment and F is for Family, but Paradise PD got more sexually explicit each time. The show is really gross.

488,1bgfck3,Casting Netflix content from an iOS device (iPhone) to a Smart TV (Sony TV with Google Android OS + with Netflix TV app pre-installed) force-opens the Netflix TV app instead of actually casting. What gives?,"Background information and thoughts:

a) Both devices seem to have the latest versions of the Netflix app installed.

b) It’s being years since I’ve cast anything from a device with Netflix to a TV. I recall it used to work seemlessly.

c) Using the ‘Cast’ button on literally any other application does exactly that… it casts the media content simply and directly onto the TV from the sourced device.

d) To my post title… pressing the Cast button during the playback of a Netflix show to my Smart TV will NOT cast as it should. It instead force-opens the Netflix TV app and asks me to login to the app on the TV. No actual casting happens as I expect it to.

So my questions are:

1. Can anybody explain what’s going on here and WHY does Netflix do this?

2. Why even have a Cast button in the iOS app if there is no actual casting?

3. Why remove a perfectly simple feature like this from the iOS Netflix app?

4. Why is Netflix stubbornly forcing its users (and TV manufacturers) to have the Netflix application installed on their TV (which takes up precious TV storage space) anytime someone wants to watch Netflix content?

At the end of the day I just want Netflix on my phone to be the only bleeping place the app is installed on. Having the Cast button is simple. Why is it gotta be like this?

Someone explain to me please what technical positive is there to do it like this?

Thanks in advanced for any helpful insight you guys have (and sorry for the rant too).

491,1bgi5p4,X is a fun slasher movie with one hell of a memorable scene I will never forget,"“X” gave me major “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” vibes right off the bat which was a nice homage to a horror classic. This is one of those movies that if you enjoy a slow burn and tension build-up, it’s for you. The only big issue I had was this all felt a bit unrealistic with antagonists that weren’t all that believable.  
  
Don’t get me wrong, I love the creativity here as that was refreshing but I expected something else due to all the hype this horror movie got. I will say though, besides that, I will never be able to listen to “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper” ever again without remembering that ONE SCENE from “X”.   
  
Don’t worry, I won’t spoil it for you but many years from now, it’ll be remembered as an iconic horror moment in movies because it was so wild, creepy, and bloody fantastic all while that song was playing. It was so damn awesome!  
  
This was a fun slasher movie with some parts that dragged on with an okay ending but overall, it’s worth watching since it’s the start of a new horror franchise. All the gore, special effects, and killer soundtrack made this a 4/5 for me and it’s worth watching on Netflix. “X” has a solid cast and a unique story to make this a memorable slasher flick.",1710628782.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bgi5p4/x_is_a_fun_slasher_movie_with_one_hell_of_a/,0.42

493,1bgytrs,The new ATLA Netflix adaptation is... ,"I watched the first two episodes and the show is so mid. The acting sucks, the charm has been completely erased and I feel zero chemistry amongst the three main characters. Everything went by so quickly and certain sequences which lasted longer in the OG show were brushed through in live action version. This is the result of modern-day Hollywood making shows have minimal episodes per season that last an hour each. Because of the original show having multiple episodes per book, the live action adaptation failed to capture every sequence in the same essence the OG show had. It all felt so rushed. Also, what were they thinking with some of the casting choices they made? Making it a live action was a huge mistake, too. The animation had way more charm than the live action ever will. I don't get Hollywoods new obsession with taking an original animated source material and turning it into a live action. 99% of the time the original is always way better, so why waste that money in the first place when you could just implement into something new and original? They had to ruin my favorite show of all time just because Hollywood is essentially a cash grab industry that's running out of ideas.

For years I’ve heard people talk about this series like it’s some amazing, unknown story in history.

Literally everything was made up. Harmon, Borgav, hell the match vs Beltik in Kentucky took place in fucking Latvia in 1955! The final match vs Borgav in “Russia” took place in Switzerland in 1993!

There were so many “clues” I thought would be later plot points like the KGB watching and “a sign from Borgav” would mean he was going to defect later and the Queen’s Gambit was a metaphor for how she’d help him escape. Or how poisoning one player’s tea meant they would do that to her.

Nope.

Total fiction loosely based on the idea if Bobby Fischer was a girl.

It makes me wonder exactly how many kids committed suicide following their experiences there. I wonder how many “accidental” deaths of children in these “schools” were covered up. I refuse to believe that no child ever died in one of those prisons.

2) Is it never okay to race swap characters, and Netflix has learned from it's mistakes?

If others feel this is worthy of consideration, I could send the best ideas to Netflix Customer Service with some metrics on how many agree.

**Problem:** scrolling around for so long that you fall asleep before finding something to watch.

**Idea:** a **Don't Display Watched** toggle to turn off the display of already watched content.

Similarly, do you agree that it would be helpful to limit displayed content to certain years? E.g.:

**Only Display Videos from YYYY** (i.e. made/released in 2007) or;  
**Only Display Videos from YYYY-YYYY** (i.e. a range of years, e.g. 1975-1987).

525,1beabhf,Netflix hasn't implemented 2-factor purposefully to gain 55% increase in profits on older accounts.,"Ok, so my Netflix account gets compromised.  Hacker adds a slot to my account and changes my plan to support the slot.  Adds himself as new member to the slot.  I get alerted after the fact via email.  

Chat with online customer support and they guide me to resetting my password, which I do.  I also see the extra account and remove it.  I ask about reverting my plan and setting up 2-factor authentication, which I've tried in the past but couldn't figure out how.

Customer support removes the extra slot but is unable to revert the plan, you see I had the basic plan at 10.81 monthly.  But that plan is NO LONGER available.  Nope, only the plan now is 16.77.  That's a nice 55% increase.  Nothing they can do, they say and I quote ""As much as I want to help you here, basic plan is no longer available in the United States for new, rejoining OR customers who plan is changed. I would be more than happy to walk you through other available plans so you can continue streaming Netflix on your favorite devices.""

I was a mess user for a very long time, and I have never heard of this happening. So, obviously, I googled it. Apparently, it does happen. But is very rare. So this brings me to the question of, what are the odds of this happening to David Taylor? Especially on the day that he wins a $10,000 lottery ticket? Which, might I add, never was found. Not to mention, on the beginning of episode four, where it shows them finding his body, five seconds before they find his body, Vicky holds up a pair of jeans that are soaked in blood and ripped in half and says they are David's. why was this never confronted in the series? It was never even questioned. It was never mentioned to his family. We never got any answers on why those pants were there or where they came from. We never got any statements on them whatsoever. Does no one else find that suspicious??? They said he had no visible injuries to his body, so why the fuck was their blood all over the pants? this whole shit just doesn't make sense. SMH.

562,1bees5a,damsel review - this thematic goldmine was the barbie movie we all should have watched,"I think a lot of films that lowkey spoil the plot in the trailer are films that aren't supposed to be watched for the plot anyway. This film was a thematic goldmine for social commentary with themes that would be difficult to catch if the audience had to focus on what came next. The film's depictions of generational trauma, having to protect the youth, breaking the patriarchy, close interactions of race and socio-economic status, appeals to those with stepparents, the value of becoming one with nature, female strength, and more, were beautiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

i wrote down my commentary as i watched the film:

“**There are many stories of chivalry where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress.** **This is not one of them**.” The film beginning with this immediately before showing Elodie chopping wood for her family is just amazing. Chopping wood and the knight saving the princess are cinematic cliches that have long been depicted as traditionally masculine tasks. Starting the movie with a scene that goes against such cliches is a powerful way to utilize media to change social norms, especially with Millie Bobby Brown being the protagonist. Thanks to Stranger Things, Gen Z has grown up with her, identifies with her, and therefore uses her as a model for life. The generation has grown up with Princess Aurora, Princess Ariel, and other protagonists who have taught young women that they need their men to come to save them, to make them feel whole, to save them, etc. For their children to learn that women can also do strong, vigorous tasks, that princesses can save themselves all on their own, and that the strength of princesses can come from other princesses is a powerful move away from the patriarchy. 

Later on, Elodie comes home to a strange woman in her home basically ""scouting"" her to be a princess of Aurea. What's important to note is that the woman takes 5 seconds to look Elodie up and down before stating ""She will do"" - indicating her approval of Elodie to become Prince Henry's wife. This is symbolic of how many high-status/high-success positions rarely utilize rigorous methods to ensure that the person is well-fit and meritable for the role - an often discussed in gender politics to argue that these positions are more based on gender than merit. Outside of gender, (I AM ONLY 5 MINUTES INTO THIS MOVIE BTW) this could also be representative of how low SES people are taken advantage of by high SES people as they wave in their faces the appeal of wealth &amp; money. It's a fucking colonization cliche we all know too well but not on a conscious enough level to realize its in everything we fucking see. 

Elodie is a fucking queen by the way. Here she is telling her father that marrying a prince of a kingdom with ""ships made of gold"" is ""no reason to marry."" I have a feeling there will be an abundance of little comments like that from this movie which will push positive messages for young women to learn from. 

As the family approaches the coastline to Aurea, they pass two eerie-looking dragons on the border of the seemingly wealthy, utopia-like kingdom. This not only acts as foreshadowing for later on in the film, as the dragon marked the beginning of the kingdom's prosperity but also is representative of a lesson that can be learned - that vigorous, hard work to slay your dragons must be done to reap the gold of your effort. No treasure comes from just sailing past your dragons like they were house decor. 

The issue of race and its close interaction with socio-economic status is very intentionally depicted in this movie. Of course the queen disrespects Elodie's colored stepmother, telling her that she is not to forget where she came from and that Aurea's royalty ""not needing any more family"" means she is not worthy of entering a family of wealth and success. They also use a colored actor to welcome the princess into Aurea. Their lack of effort to give the ""future royalty"" a beautiful welcome - given the wealth they have - is representative of how careless they were for Elodie's family. However, the family's lack of a concept of wealth - stated by Elodie herself - caused them to overlook this, thinking that their welcome was more than enough due to the sharp contrast from their homeland. 

The appeal to the rather large audience of those with step-parents is also fairly beautiful. Elodie confides in her sister about how she misses her biological mother. Her sister replies saying that her stepmother is also there as a shoulder to lean on. This is perhaps a message that many children in the United States - a country with high rates of divorce - might need to listen to, that paternal/maternal figures, guardians, people who can and will support us, people who mean well, and more do not have to be biological family. These people can be anyone as long as we allow ourselves to lean on them (and of course as long as they mean well). 

WAHHH and Elodie's younger sister Floria telling her ""You're Elodie. You can do anything."" is so cute as well - that our support system also comes from those younger than us, that elder siblings do not always need to be the strongest and impenetrable, that younger siblings play a part in being there for their older siblings as well. 

Floria's innocence and enamor over the wealth of Aurea's castle is symbolic of how much we need to protect our youth. Often can the youth be so focused on what they want that is being waved in front of them (on social media) that they forget to think about who is waving it. 

God, there's so much hidden foreshadowing in this film. Henry bringing Elodie to the edge of a cliff when they go on their first date, the rotten flower being replaced with a fresh one like nothing ever happened, etc. The trilogies I can write on this movie. 

Elodie's stepmother comes in to warn her that just because the family is royalty, that does not mean they are good people. This is a message I think we all need to hear given the war on attention that we have fallen into on social media. Often is our attention grabbed by social media influencers by waving in our faces things that we want, that we are deprived of. This is often what leads to them gaining ""followers"" and us monitoring their every post on social media. Just because these social media influencers have what we want, that does not mean they are good people. 

The story of Aurea represents how corruption is fueled when status and occupational obligations are valued more than love and connection. The King gives up his beloved daughters to protect his kingdom. This is touched on even more when the dragon says to Elodie ""The scent of royalty betrays you"" - like hell yeah it fucking does. 

Lowkey is it just me or does this feel like a Los Angeles/Fame/Celebrity cliche lmfao, aka. sacrifice someone from your family to sell your soul to us and we'll reward you with fame and fortune. The weird red costumes with devil-horn/illuminati-ram-horn hats, the two dragons at the coastline of Aurea shaped in the same way, the slicing of blood on Elodie's hand, the weird masks during the sacrificial ceremony, etc. 

Just realized the tree that Elodie falls next to right after they throw her down could potentially be a tabebuia AUREA tree, or a golden trumpet tree. Google says these trees are known in Feng Shui for symbolizing a ""kindling of the fire within"" (aka channeling your inner fire-breathing dragon to fight fire with fire ahhahaha god i love this movie) and ""boosting motivation and enthusiasm."" AKA EVERYTHING THAT ELODIE NEEDS AT HER QUITE LITERAL LOWEST.

I will dedicate this paragraph to my commentary on Elodie's character development as she is in the cave. She begins the film running away from the dragon at her first sight of it, crying in fear and hiding from it. Her first signs of courage and bravery comes from her mother's strength, saying to herself ""Mother wanted you to fight."" However, her strength is also drawn from learning from other women - such as Victoria, Beatrice, Artemis, Genevieve, Fatima, Carlotta, etc. - who have been in her position. She not only learned from their actions (what Victoria wrote on the wall, the map on the wall, etc.) but also honored their names and used their deaths as another source of strength for her to fight and not hide until her death. Her disappointment after she reaches the top of the crystal cave is also a lesson in itself. Sometimes going toward the light and moving upwards does not mean you will get to where you need to be. Sometimes the path least expected is the path most rewarding, in this case, the path is not running away from the dragon but facing it head-on and slicing it for once and for all (read later for my paragraph on generational trauma). 

The nature of the dragon is also carefully thought of. ""Now my favorite part...RUN!"" it first says to Elodie. Our dragons want us to run away from them, to live in fear and not overcome them, to not channel our strength and potential, to not face them with pride and bravery, to take the easy way out, to submit to our emotions, etc. But the dragons can also be representative of our generational trauma (which is also very appropriate for Elodie being an eldest daughter), and that beating generational trauma means going against what has been done in for centuries, channeling strength from those in the past who have suffered, exerting hard work and courage to bring about change, etc. On top of generational trauma, the dragons are representative of the patriarchy and of colonization. Often women and future generations have to deal with the mistakes and stubbornness of men/colonizers in the past whether or not they had to do with it. 

This theme of protecting the youth and ending generational trauma is so beautifully depicted actually. With 27min left in the movie, Elodie goes back into the caves to save her daughter. This represents how we need to face our traumas, acknowledge the strength we have learned from them, channel the strength of those who have been traumatized in the past, and take the fire head-on for the sake of our loved ones and future generations to not inflict further harm on them and to end generational trauma. 

OMG HER WEDDING DRESS!!!! THEY DRESSED HER IN BANDAGES AND HID A KNIFE FOR HER!!! THE EGG AS A LIGHT!!! WAHHHH WHAT A DETAIL!!

At the beginning of the movie, Elodie's mother tells her and her sister that ""first impressions are everything"" - that first impressions are THE deciding factor behind whether someone has a positive outlook on your character or not. What's beautiful about this movie is that by the end of it, you learn that a lasting impression on your character is less impacted by your first impression and more impacted by the work you put in to build your character (yet another positive message for young women to focus more on their internal coolness and less on their external appearance).

The icicles above the pond of mossy/seaweedy water is quite a nice lesson as well. The easiest/most accessible rewards often aren't as rewarding as those that come with time and patience, but don't an overindulgence of these rewards (especially when you're deprived of them) bring down your guard from those (such as a fiery breathing dragon) who may take it away from you. 

Being one with nature is also such a beautifully depicted theme in this film. It proposes a life where human dominance and anthropocentrism are abandoned in favor of harmonious coexistence with plants and animals, trusting their intelligence as much as we trust our own and understanding that we have a symbiotic relationship with the earth. Often when nature inflicts pain on us is a call for our attention - to tell us that we caused them pain (the dragons), that they need our help (the glow worms). The end is so beautiful because Elodie ends the film not by fighting the dragon, but by understanding the dragon's pain, acknowledging the part it played in the generational trauma, and working with it (not against it) to end it once and for all.",1710398070.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bees5a/damsel_review_this_thematic_goldmine_was_the/,0.33

Why do we always have to turn on CC subtitles - For the Deaf. In order to understand the German speaking parts. which are not that many, but then we have to turn them off again for the rest of the film.

When these films are released on DVD, this is automatic, depending on the language you select.

This is not hard to do.

If I select English as my preferred language, then you activate the subtitle stream for only the foreign speaking parts.

When you purchase the licence for these films, are these not supplied to you, are you too lazy to include these extra streams, Christ it's a 10kb text file.  It's not that hard to do.

For reference, when I play the live action Avatar, the stats say that it's streaming at 4k at a bitrate of 17927. The picture looks crisp and amazing, even when in motion.

Will the bitrate for The Gentlemen get better if I wait a few days or a few weeks? Because this is unacceptable when I'm paying for the 4k plan. It's unwatchable at this state, and it's a damn shame because the cinematography looks beautiful as hell. Why on Earth would Netflix limit the bitrate so hilariously low for a show that they just released?

Edit: 2 days later the max bitrate is still 450. Wtf Netflix

Edit 2: 4 days later the bitrate is still 450. Do they not want people to watch this show or what

Edit 3: 10 days later and still 450 for 2560x1440p. For some godforsaken reason it's 1026 for 1920x1080p.",1710083718.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1bbcn8l/bitrate_is_abysmal_for_the_gentlemen_will_it_ever/,0.58

Even the metal references of Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio made my metalhead heart happy. This was a horror masterpiece and gave me all sorts of Scream/Terrifier vibes due to how vicious this movie gets as it progresses.

I also enjoyed how it was a modern take on a slasher horror movie by using cell phones, social media, and technology. It’s incredible and not only delivered on the hype but will be one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Who knows, maybe this is the start of a new horror franchise as they did officially announce a sequel is coming in 2025.

642,1bao9g6,The Gentlemen - Stanley Johnston's Philosophy for real or a scam ?," 

Hi everyone!

I'm a French guy who just discovered ""The Gentlemen"" series on Netflix and got hooked. I particularly enjoyed Giancarlo's first appearance, portraying another Gus Fring-like character in the cast.

Presented to the Duke, they quickly discussed William Kent, a jack of all trades, his feral and refined philosophy, and how to be a lion in high society and business.

I found this quite appealing, but so far, I've been unable to find any books written by this Mr. Kent. Only a few articles about a famous architect-gardener, a stroller maker, and a thriller author on Amazon, but nothing resembling what they were talking about in the series.

So, is he a real author with significant writings, or just a brilliant creation for the show?   
As a non-English native, I'm easily deceived.

I watched the movie yesterday and was completely blown away with it. The premise, the cinematography, the actors and acting was superlative to say the least. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

I then started binging on the show albeit with less expectations since it does not feature any of the major stars from the movie (Mathew Mcconaughey, Colin Farrell or Huge  Grant). However i must say the show so far (3 eps in) is equally good.

Typical Guy Ritchie direction with slick screenplay &amp; humor.

660,1ba997y,"Episode 1 of ""Pluto"" Anime Was So Badly Written It Killed My Interest In the Anime","So my wife and I were kind of interested in watching an episode of the “Pluto” anime on Netflix. A robot detective investigates a serial killer killing robots and humans? Very “I, Robot!” Very “Caves of Steel!”

And the first third of the anime was just what we’d hoped for: a robot detective investigates a series of murders. Lots of clues, lots of mysteries in a futuristic world, very interesting.

And then this completely different anime about an aging composer and his robot companion crashed into the story and took over. I mean it CRASHED into the anime, it was very much like flipping the channels on the remote and watching a completely different anime, except that the animation style was the same and the world was the same.

And this intrusion included no characters from the beginning, there was no direct linkage AT ALL between the two stories. What’s more, the new story took up almost all of the rest of the episode, except for maybe two minutes’ worth at the end.

And worst of all, the old blind composer guy story was DULL and SLOW and BORING. And SAPPY. It was wrong on every level. 

Of course, having watched that godawful piece of shit excuse for a first episode I might think, well we’re back on the detective track at the end, hopefully the rest of the anime will be all fun and interesting futuristic robot detective story.

But I don’t actually believe that. Crashing one story into another like that is a total writing noob mistake. It’s the sort of thing that gets pounded out of actual writers in grade school.  

I don’t know why it wasn’t pounded out of the clod who wrote Episode 1 of “Pluto” but I know I have NO faith that the rest of the series will be decently written. I think it’s gonna suck, big time. Writing blunders as basic as this one are so grotesquely awful that they constitute proof that the screenwriter/whoever is a total and complete fuckup and is not worth paying attention to until they learn their craft.

668,1b9tsl1,"Damsel (2024)-A mixture of Ready or Not by way of Dragonslayer, Damsel manages to be a well-made inverted fairy tale.","In a northern land ravaged by frost and famine, Lord Bayford (Ray Winstone) is sent a letter from Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright) of the Kingdom of Aurea requesting princess Elodie’s (Millie Bobby Brown) hand in marriage to her son Henry (Nick Robinson). Once in Aurea Elodie and her family are taken aback by how rich and elegant the kingdom is while Elodie’s stepmother Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett) feels something isn’t quite right. After Elodie and Henry are married and engage in a ceremony commemorating a tragedy that befell Aurea from an ancient beast that resulted in sacrifices to maintain prosperity with Elodie now the latest sacrifice as she is tossed into the caves. Within the caves lurks a fire breathing dragon (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and now Elodie must repurpose her royal trappings and use her wits if she wishes to escape the caves with her life.

Damsel sees Netflix reteam with star Millie Bobby Brown and producers Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum with the streaming having worked with Brown on the very successful Stranger Things TV series and Enola Holmes films while Roth and Kirschenbaum previously gave them the YA fantasy film The School for Good and Evil. Netflix secured the rights to Damsel shortly after the success of acquiring Enola Holmes in 2020 and after waiting for Covid conditions to die down and shoot the film and having its release delayed by the strikes last year, Damsel is now available on Netflix and if you’re looking for a straightforward but well-made inverted fairy tale this is reasonably entertaining.

Much like prior Joe Roth fantasy productions, Damsel features some polished looking kingdoms with ornate and elaborate sets and costume designs but the movie is at its strongest when it steps away from those trappings and instead opts for grittier and modest surroundings like Elodie’s winter-ravaged northern kingdom or the elaborate cave system that serves as the dragon’s lair. In many ways it feels like it’s not too far removed from the universe of Joe Roth’s films like Snow White and the Huntsman or The Huntsman: Winter’s War even down to Robin Wright’s Queen Isabelle inviting comparisons to Charlize Theron’s Queen Ravenna from those films (while also being the least interesting part of the movie proper in what’s a pretty thankless role). Where the movie exceeds however is in Shohreh Aghdashloo’s vocal performance as the dragon who creates a memorable, menacing, and often times frightening antagonist and making herself a welcome addition to the pantheon of cinematic dragons (especially ones that speak). Not only does the dragon sound good, but it’s also well designed with a striking, distinct, and expressive face that the effects team are to be commended for crafting.

But this of course leads us to the titular Damsel of the film and much like Millie Bobby Brown’s prior headlining features she’s no less good here and shows strong presence in lengthy stretches where she’s the only character on screen and has to react to effects that will be put in later. We’ve certainly seen this kind of “anti-princess” fairy tale setup before with the Joey King movie The Princess coming to mind as a recent example, and while its become a well-worn trope at this point Damsel doesn’t linger too hard on it and keeps its focus primarily on the survival game which is its strong suit. Angela Bassett also feels like she’s kind of wasted in a role that has promise with her being a more benevolent stepmother in contrast to the fairy tale trope, but unfortunately like Robin Wright it feels more like a placeholder role that doesn’t allow too much.

Damsel creates a memorable antagonist and a solid hero and pits the two against each other in entertaining and often brutal ways in an efficient and effective manner. Some of producer Joe Roth’s tropes with the fantasy genre are showing their age with diminishing returns, but there is enough new added elements especially with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo’s taught direction that fans of grittier fantasy fare such as Dragonslayer will find plenty to appreciate.",1709918959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1b9tsl1/damsel_2024a_mixture_of_ready_or_not_by_way_of/,0.77

This series is way different. The HD and color makes it feel like you are right there. Restored audio from interviews is very chilling.

679,1b9aexa,Spaceman Review: Middling Sandler Sci-Fi,"

I wish that the story were more investing but I think the performances and the visual effects were enough to save this from any lower than a 6/10. 

Pros: Adam Sandler and Paul Dano’s chemistry was great, and the visual effects with the creature design and on the space setting looks great too. I liked the heart to heart between Mulligan and Sandler in the middle of the movie, and trippy climax and emotional reconciliation at the end. 

Cons: The premise for the movie is engaging enough, but the slow pacing and uninteresting scenes make this not as fun to watch as I was expecting.

I cancelled my netflix when the doc came out.  Thought after all the hardcore public shaming this company and its employees, production companies and actors/actresses would take a hint.

But no....

I used to love learning about the gods of past but now I realize history is for the evil assholes to be remembered.

Ragnorak the tv series as the principal whom is a female monster giant have sex with her students during a school dance and then the executive assistant to the giants company president states at the end she didnt want to date her boss when he decided to give the reins to his sister whom desired all the power.  The executive assistant is obv older and the son just got out of high school.

I have come to believe that professsionals and office workers are disgusting as I have seen my fair share of this behaviour in real life working in offices at govt and corporate offices.   You wonder why we are always told to order dark office tables for boardroom meetings.  Yup.  They have to be sturdy and not see through.

Barf.

I have also come to believe that all this shit isnt going away, but only getting worse, because society has been influenced since the pinup girls to be pervered and gross when it comes to sex, groups, being included, desiring to be more than you are, and profit and power.

Needless to say I wasted $10 on the Netflix membership and will be cancelling again, forever.

Amazon Prime is getting there as well with their gross shit.  I think I may be cancelling that as well.

I purposely took my time with this series and stayed away from public opinion so all I know is that there was enough support for them to release seasons 2 and 3. 

Here are my primitive thoughts:
-story was overall pretty accurate, and followed a lot of the original series. Obviously there were some changes and aspects that were omitted but I don’t think there was anything I’m angry about. The pacing however felt very rushed and ending at 8 episodes?? I’m hoping the second and third seasons will be longer and include more details that align with the animated series :)
-casting… please don’t come at me, I just want to share my opinion in a civil manner. When the cast was released I was really disappointed. But I didn’t let it stop me from watching it. I gotta say— Aang, Sokka, Katara, Iroh, Ozai, Zhao, and ZUKO!! really really surprised me. Oh man, especially zuko— my opinion has changed 180 because he, and the rest listed, embody the characters SO WELL. Even though visually my image of zuko was different, I really feel like he played the part so well in the live action. HOWEVER, Azula. (And MAI, umm wth?!) She really really does not give the character justice. None of the arrogant sharp characteristics, and I’m also talking about her execution. She was 0% like Azula. I feel bad for feeling so against her casting, but I was hoping for a badass and cunning fox-like character… only to get a soft panda. Man… just finished it and there’s that 10% lacking feeling, and now we probably have to wait at least 2 years before we can see how they’ve progressed.

It might take some a couple  episodes to get into it BUT I PROMISE for those who haven't taken the  time to watch yet, give the show a couple of episodes to digest and I  think you all will be shocking and pleasantly surprised....

For  those who are watching for the first time please share your thoughts as  I am sure we would luv to see what others think on REDDIT.

722,1b7m5s9,Can someone recommend a show on Netflix which an episode of this theme,"Hello. It's the Inernational Women Day this week, and I desire make a compilation of kids shows (live-actions or cartoons) that have a MALE protagonist, a GROUP as main cast (not a duo, like Adventure Time), and an episode where a girl (in preference, all girls) of the main group, rescue/save the life of all the boys in the group (even the protagonist). Like, not extra characters, but the main cast involved. 

I prefer the most some magic or powers envolved on this, to make more a strong theme.

At first i thought the plot and story were pretty good so i mainly just watched it for that, but now im on episode 6 and it has been steadily getting worse and worse to the point where i don’t really want to watch the rest of this show

So many things happen that make no sense or have no explanation, and then stuff gets very disjointed and it just feels like the overall direction and vision got completely screwed up

The dad driss was supposed to be in prison and now he suddenly runs the whole place and they all listen to him? What the hell is that? That is the most ridiculous thing ever, it makes no sense and was just done for the sake of having a plot twist

He kills Selma and none of that was shown, they just say he did it and thats it. What a lame way to end an important character

Lyna was never trained at all in how to shoot a gun but she somehow has amazing accuracy

747,1b6ogjw,"""Spaceman"" is kind of irritating and way too mopey"," I am still watching ""Spaceman"" but I can't say it's turning into a *great* movie.

Here's my big complaint: Jakob (Adam Sandler) is a cosmonaut traveling to the far reaches of the solar system to **EXPLORE**, to **LEARN**, and yet, when an earth-shattering, totally unprecedented ***FIRST CONTACT WITH AN INTELLIGENT ALIEN SPECIES*** event occurs, he's just like, ""Oh. A spider-alien. I'll just go about my astro-business"" and is extremely uncurious about his new shipmate.

He asks Spiderguy very few questions and isn't really taken aback by Spiderguy's presence (he's scared at first but gets over it quickly) , and is generally pretty low-energy, mopey, and lacking in the curiosity and excitement that I would *\*think\** a cosmonaut like him would possess.

Also, why would they send a single, solitary man on a mission like this? Redundancy is pretty important in space missions. And solitude is a mind-warper. None of this makes any damn sense.

We are pursuing mediation on the fee through our credit card company (with varying results so far, but still discussing).

762,1b672cr,Avatar the last airbender live action,"Yall are being so picky i swear to god. This is one of the best live actions i have seen. Even way better than most of the disney attempts. And yea the acting and dialogue could be better, but i honestly love the fact that its not trying to be so much… after all the lead roles are children, i dont expect them to be overly charming, saka has the wit, and katara has the calming energy. YAY. thats why i couldn’t get behind stanger things because everything they said felt too much like an adult was feeding kids lines. I loveee the fact that they stuck to the original cartoon so much, and the fact that the animals don’t look laughable like the monster in Wednesday. Its beautiful what they did and makes me feel so nostalgic.

  
edit:- um... hi everyone ,,,after reading the negative comments on this post, i didnt quite understand why people couldnt outlook the negative things of the live action and thought they were just being nitpicky. anyway it inspired me to rewatch the cartoon and..... IM SORRY YALL WERE SO RIGHT- i mean dont get me wrong i still really enjoyed the live action, but it was such a long time ago since i watch the cartoon. and now i understand why the og fans were upset. its not because theyre being picky or want an exact copy of the cartoon, its because the live show either took away key traits of characters or completely changed them. examples i noticed:- 1-zuko fighting back in the agni kai, he would have never fought back because of his fear of his dad and also to show respect. and the fact that his father still hurt him makes him more of a heartless man. the show didnt only forget about this but made it seem like zuko couldve even HAD A CHANCE to hurt the fire lord. like....HUH?? 2- azula standing up to her father and refusing to follow instructions, no matter her reasons she wouldnt talk back, this is very important because it also shows us the crazy powerful perfect azula looked up to one person and one person only. her dad. 3- aang not learning to water bend at all. I HAD NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE WERE SO UPSET BY THIS BUT REWATCHING THE SHOW IT CLICKED. katara was meant to be JEALOUS of aangs abilities so when she actually progresses as a water bender it shows her humility is by teaching aang, and how she is hardworking and caught up to his abilities. its important for her character so...netflix just made her perfect at it because of a scroll and and they didnt really make her go through anything. katara was just doing cool water bending which made her character hollow. anyway i think there are more reasons why the fans are upset but these are the key things ive caught since rewatching. i thought the netflix show resembled the cartoon pretty well because i didnt even remember much of it. anyway i still think the show was good, i just now understand why the original creators had left the writing team for the live action show. im still very excited to see the upcoming seasons, since the show we watched began filimg 3 years ago. i hope they take the criticism well and better the show.

767,1b5ttii,[SPOILER] What happened to Gesicht in pluto make little sense to me,"In the last episode i realised that there was something incoherent with how Gesicht had died.

In the series they always talk about moving the robot's brain in another body, as Goji did to meet body early in the story. 

So why didn't they do so when Gesicht was shot and everyone got the signal ? 

Now there is the possibility that: Maybe the robotic brains need some fuel, to be constantly charged with electricity as they have very little storage for electricity. 

But it is a bit weird honestly in a sci-fi world like in Pluto and also: is there really so little battery capacity that they don't have time to contact the authorities and save him ? Because they invested millions, so seeing him not having any secondary security system is weird

Multiple people also said that blabla he's soo complex and all, he normally wouldn't fit another body. And so when the body's gone, his soul as well. Which would be valid i think. 

Because let's not forget that Tenma is a master in making electronical brains, and Abullah is also pretty good, so obviously you could argue that Goji's brain better than Gesicht and then that's normal that it works for one and not the other. In this aspect it would feel a bit less like an ass pull.

And same would go for Sahad/Pluto since Abullah/Goji must have learned from Tenma (even if his disorder won't allow him to be fully intelligent)

Fell free to tell what you think and well even if it is a bit of a shame if i'm right, i know the series is much more than that

I love it btw

776,1b5g7od,"I heard in netflix avatar, the previous avatar say Aang u have to do this alone. Doesnt that make the concept of avatar pointless?","I didnt see the series so I watched a lot of reviews on the show and a lot of reviewers say that previous avatars say Aang u have to do this alone. But isnt the whole avatar concept is that avatar had to learn all the elements by traveling the world. Thats why Roku wont teach Aang all the elements, right? I watched a discussion on OG series that some people say why dont Roku just teach Aang all the elements. IN OG we have two things. Just hear me out. 

1) Aang wont talk to Roku in the beggining whenever he wants. The first time was on solictice and it was a special event and Aang could talk to him for a brief time and every other time after that was very short as well.

2) Roku explicitly told Aang or one of the other avatars, avatar had to be human and he must travel the world to learn other elements. Cuz avatar's duty is to the world and avatar cant isolate himself from the world, avatar had to protect. 

These two main reasons, previous avatars wont teach Aang even in that desperate state of the world.

Well he can go to spirit world but in there, there is no bending so all they do is give pointers to him and that is not gonna help much. But in netflix, well it is so easy to teach him since he can talk to them in there temple and time isnt that much issue so just teach him there, maybe?

Also Aang cant be alone cuz he is gonna learn other elements from masters and look those masters also fighting to fire lord Ozai. Is he gonna say ""yeah u taught me but after here on I am alone so stay here wait for the good news"".

I know he says to Bumi I am gonna be with my friends but that change to me is destroys the avatar concept in this world so why change it?

Another thing I heard is Zuko isnt that much held on to gaining his honor but becoming a fire lord? What does that mean? I saw the scene Zuko almost defeat his father. If he is that much bend on to becoming a fire lord then go kill your father and become one, maybe? Since he can defeat him. After Zuko becomes a good guy why not let him kill his father instead of Aang? Why is he gonna need Aang at that point? I know we are gonna throw that cuz if we dont then later seasons will be flimsy.",1709469447.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1b5g7od/i_heard_in_netflix_avatar_the_previous_avatar_say/,0.19

SATC ran 98-2004...  back then was just a hit comedy series, award winner...  didn't trigger anyone or create outrage.

when they sold the cleaned up versions to TBS and E they found a younger generation of fans who were too young to watch a few years earlier. the show doubled it's fanbase. but those fans didn't realize how R rated the series really was. Some fans reaction to the spinoff series' more adult adventures seemed shocked because they never saw the original series uncensored. 

4 years later the movie made 400 million and that's when the fanboy misogyny stuff started to pop up.

so i'm wondering what it's gonna be like...  for some fans of the clean edited version maybe seeing the R rated one for the first time. because it really is a LOT of outrageous crazy dialogue and sex scenes. if you think Anyone But You is adult you have no idea.

798,1b49r0b,I'm trying to give Wednesday a 2nd chance. I hate it even more now,"Anybody who likes this show, please  stay strong in your beliefs and please don't let me ruin it for you.

Did Wednesday bring anything that Sabrina wasn't already doing better? The premise of Wednesday goes to private high school with other spooky students and starts doing detective work to discover a serial killer could still have been done so much better while also respecting the source material. I know  I'm not the first to say this, so I'll try to say what could have been done to make Wednesday better.

First, there is no reason to even start with the superpowers crap. Even if you want to try occult detective tropes, like maybe dial it down to some sort of witchcraft powers learned from Grandmama, and make it way more narrow like using witchcraft to talk to the dead or maybe like Dead Zone powers, maybe. Maybe. But good Lord, he writers from Smallville and other superhero crap want to take Wednesday Addams, a character with no superpowers, and their first idea is to make her Jean Gray because they want to do something different with the character, and also they do the same with Gomez and Tish? Does it do anything other than maybe giving a cheap way to solve mysteries? Nope. 

The Wednesday isn't always evil plot holes. There is a very easy way the writers of The Addams Family dealt with their characters acting out of character or doing good things that didn't make sense. Give a line of dialogue that explains their motives were evil. So, why does Wednesday want to capture a killer when she herself likes killers? ""He was taking the spotlight from me by dealing out the misery I wanted to cause."" Joke and plot hole fixed in one line. ""I'm not angry at father for murdering the guy. I'm angry at him for not planning it."" Joke and plot hole fixed. 

Also, why is everybody fawning over her and fighting for her affection? She's antisocial, people should not like her but a select few will grow to like her after being forced to be with her and finding common ground. The whole concept of these other characters sort of existing in the Addams culture while also existing in common culture doesn't work. If you have characters as outsider or popular, that fixes the problem of characters who are begging to hang out with Wednesday and afraid she's going to kill them in the next scene and round and round that behavior goes.

Spread out the cryptic one-liner comebacks. Not every single line of dialogue from Wednesday has to be ""oh yea? dead people."" Let her personality breathe. Let her emote when the moment is right. In fact, give personality to the other characters, too. Gomez doesn't have to dry hump Tish just because you don't have dialogue for him. We know wolf girl likes to wolf and she Wolverine's her claws and pink stuff. She can do more than that. 

Imagine if Batman is in high school, he's popular with all the kids, all the boys and girls fight over romance with him, he shoots fireballs from his hands, and he tries to help mystery killers get even more kills. He wears the suit, looks like Batman, even says a lot of the things Batman would say. Is that Batman? That should be asked when writing these characters. 

My deepest apologies again. That's just a brief tip of the iceberg start to fix this. I'm positive we can do this before Beetlejuice gets vampire powers and tries to hunt down DB Cooper.

809,1b433mk,“Warrior” On Netflix (Please Read),"Hello, it may seem like this subreddit is being spammed by Warrior fans like a troll or something however it’s not that case at all, we are just dying to have Netflix renew it for a future season as they have just put it up on their platform on the 16th of February, Warrior is one of the best shows I’ve seen in the last decade, i am very picky about what i watch probably due to me being in my late 20’s and only liked shows like “Snowfall, Breaking Bad, Sons Of Anarchy, Mayans, Last Of Us, Doom Patrol” etc u get the point lol but as for Bruce Lee’s “Warrior” when i started to watch it i LOVED it instantly, i can assure this show is a banger for sure filled with crazy good fight scenes, gang warfare within Chinese tongs (gangs), and a really good plot all together about San Francisco’s Chinatown in the 1870’s i binged the first 2 season’s within a week when i watched it and was very disappointed to learn that Cinemax cancelled it due to closing all their originals so there wasn’t a season 3 even in the process of being made at the time, however kinda where we are right now is where i was in 2021 After so much begging from a cult following i was so excited and thrilled that HBO Max had picked it back up for a Season 3 and then after they just abandoned it for literally no reason and giving it literally 0 promotion they cancelled it again last December in 2023 after season 3 aired with no green light moving forward, the fact that almost the whole cast came back to film S3 shows how much this show means especially while a few went on to film triple A films like “Bullet Train”, “Snake Eyes” and “Mortal Kombat” prior to the creation of season 3. Please atleast give this show a chance if you are looking for a show to watch thats binge worthy and definitely has replay value in any season or episode. Seeing more fans coming in due to Netflix and the fact its been in the Top 10 since it came out brings me hope again and why im even typing this. U won’t be disappointed and u will be helping us out and contributing to it being revived once again now that Netflix is giving it some spotlight. If you actually read this far down thanks alot. #BringBackWarrior ",1709321419.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1b433mk/warrior_on_netflix_please_read/,0.74

These 2 series have a lot in common, even if they are set in separate timelines, and far away from each other geographically as well.

818,1b3vwdl,Netflix is intentionally hurting Android TV subscribers with 540p.,"IM sorry for my bad English. Netflix limits Android devices to 540p. I have an Nvidia Shield 2019. I have never used its ESN in the Kodi addon. In the official Netflix app, my resolution is 540p. I have 4k on the Netflix app on the Samsung TV and on the PS5.The Sony TV is also 540p.There are two threads on the Nvidia Shield forum for other users that confirm this:

​This is more than scandalous to me. I'm sure Netflix is intentionally hurting Android subscribers with 540p.You pay for a 4k subscription - you get 540p if you watch on Android TV.Samsung TV and PS5 - 2160 pNvidia Shield 2019 and Sony TV-540 p

One of the core characters of the show: the captain Penisi is incredibly unlikable and yet people love him and constantly laugh at his jokes. Jokes that are mostly calling other men pussies and inserting his catchphrase “i’m Eddie penisi” wherever he can, always asserting he is a womanizer to people who for some reason agree with him? 

The shows side characters are pretty funny though and likable. Andy, the chief, &amp; Ike are funny and their characters are believable. There are some lines where they really get to shine Their timing is good. Unfortunately a lot of the writing is weak and there are more jokes that fall flat than land. Lucy’s character is given nothing.

However, I am on episode 5 and am pleasantly surprised with what they have done. 
They have mixed and matched plot points that keeps the show familiar but with a slightly different story setting. Bringing together Omashu, Jet and Teo worked well, covering all three. 
The costumes are not too overdone (my main gripe with One Piece)  and the acting is getting better with each episode.  
The only weak point is Katara's characterization.  They have taken out her intensity. I have no other way to describe her except she gives me TikTok vibes in the way her dialogues are delivered but this I attribute to the direction of her character. 
Shout out to Zuko and Sokka! Zuko particularly has been done well. 

Live action cannot hold a candle to the original which for the time really broke boundaries in story telling and resonated so deeply but considering the limitations of the world and the magic system, this is a good effort and I hope its renewed for further seasons with viewer feedback. 

Hoping the rest of the episodes do not let me down.

I watched this series:

[https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/81133260](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/81133260)

"" You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment

 Identical twins change their diets and lifestyles for eight weeks in a  unique scientific experiment designed to explore how certain foods  impact the body. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I watched the first Episode and it was (almost) fine, but then I started episode 2 and I was like ""WHAT... NO"".

The Series have a age recommendation of 6, so yeah it's okay to watch with kids.

Episode 2 starts with a LOT talking about Adult ""love"" movie stuff (I don't use the name here now).

The woman had to undress the lower body to get their intimate area scanned while watching those movies.

It was disgusting for me, THAT was not what I wanted to learn about eating, yeah maybe eating have impact on how your bed adventure time may change, but... sorry no interest.

And is that REALLY related to 6 year old kids, who may watch that with their parents and then may ask them ""Mommy what is a P\*\*\*o movie."" (I censored it).

&amp;#x200B;

I invite everyone to tell their own opinione, maybe watch the second episode or whatever.

I thinked multiple times about posting it and now I did decide to do it, this was just a NOPE for me.

And I don't want to continue the series, because I'm afraid I will see it multiple times.

I am feeling very paranoid that I will try to show the film on the projector next week, and students will get a blank screen.  I tried reaching out to Netflix about my questions, but I don't think the person I talked to knew the answers.  They just copy/pasted the Help section I had already read.

So I'm asking any teachers here, have you tried showing any of those films that Netflix cleared?  Was there an additional process you had to go through beyond having a Netflix account?  Or can I just show it on the projector like I normally would and will just play?

Last question, I know they have limits, so you could only do one screening at a time.  So if I did a test run this week to make sure everything worked, would I still be able to show it to my students next week.

The level of mess these people of authority go to protect person of interest to these 3 letter organizations is simply unbelievable (Shown through a journalist's eyes in this doc).

it makes a significantly worse viewing experience since the livestream player doesn't show how long the episode is, or how much time has been watched, or how much time is left. Here is what the interface looks like on Drive to Survive:

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I have a 21:9 monitor (Dell AW34 series) and I'm watching at native resolution with HDR on

&amp;#x200B;

I started watching AtLA last night and was quite enjoying it. Everything was going good and nothing was wrong. However, this morning I woke up and launched the show again only to be greeted by both vertical and horizontal black bars, meaning I was watching the show on what is essentially a smaller screen.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't get is how it was perfectly fine last night (No black bars except for a couple of pixels horizontally) and is also fine when I launch  other 21ish-9 content on Netflix but not on AtLA...

&amp;#x200B;

I tried watching on Chrome and Edge but they both have their own share of problems. I downloaded the plugin on both browsers that is supposed to fix the issue. But the black bars remain on chrome unless I turn off hardware acceleration which would be alright if the quality wasn't so bad. On Edge the quality seems to be much better except HDR doesn't work properly.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: Does anyone know how I can watch the film like I did last night? On the Netflix App without these horrendously large black bars on every side? At this point I'd even accept just removing the ones on the top and bottom.",1709043515.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1b1cxiq/black_borders_around_avatar_the_last_airbender/,0.57

904,1b0iwal,Account got hacked and plan got changed: UPDATE! ,"Hi lovely people!! I made a post a few weeks ago that I have attached to this post if anyone wants to get the full background to what happened. 

Long story short, my account got hacked and the hacker upgraded the plan, taking me off the basic plan that I was “grandfathered” into. There are many redditors that have posted that the same situation happened to them and netflix was refusing to allow any of us to get our old membership type back, telling us we now had to all abide by the new upgrade and would not be able to go back to our original plan, and that we would have to pay more monthly now to continue using netflix since our old plan was no longer offered. 

Another issue with this situation was that no one was able to speak to a manager, the call would get disconnected when you were finally promised to speak to one, and there was really no solution that netflix was offering anyone to make this right. 

I wanted to update you guys since I know this has been such a prevalent issue, but I called netflix back today to try and get this settled, and they instantly agreed to change my plan back to the basic plan for the original price I was paying. They said that they were aware of the issue happening to multiple customers and have been instructed to change the plans back to the basic plan if this has happened to anyone. 

So if you were one of those people that also had your account hacked and upgraded and were unable to get netflix to agree to change it back, now is your chance to call them and get it fixed!!!   ",1708957926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/s/dKj06TxcUF,0.68

914,1b04joc,Avatar the Last Airbender is Exceptionally... Mediocre,"ATLA is just another in a series of reasons why ATLA should just be left alone. To do this series any true justice you need a Marvel movie type budget. The series isn't bad or completely unenjoyable, but it misses (by a long shot) the magic that the cartoon has.

Probably the most notable issue is the acting. Only a few actors truly pulled off the characters well. Iroh and Zuko are arguably the saving grace of this show. A fair number of side characters are alright as well. And many of the actors do a good job at specific aspects of characters, Sokka and Aang for example feel like those characters we know sometimes, but don't quite hit the mark. Sokka isn't sarcastic enough, and both Sokka and Aang need to increase their goofiness factor by 100. Katara never truly gets angry or annoyed. And pretty much every character has troubles delivering lines in anyway that feels interesting.

The fighting in ATLA is arguably one of the most important parts of the cartoon series. It was the thing that made it feel so magical. Yet ATLA(N) combats feel stale and feature a lot of hand to hand combat over the use of bending. There are also a number of ""that was VERY obviously CGI"" moments where the characters are suddenly poorly animated models and their movements feel VERY stiff and unrealistic.

However, I think the thing that really brings this series far below its cartoon predecessor is the removal of so many moments that were really the heart of the series. Moments like riding the Elephant Koi, chasing Flopsie during Bumi's trials, or Aang and Katara's first kiss in the Secret Tunnel. We missed moments like the swamp, where we get glimpses of Toph, Yue, and more. And where the heck was Roku's dragon? We miss true moments of conflict from Aang like in the episodes ""The Great Divide"" and ""The Northern Air Temple."" Frankly, we skip over any real conflict that Aang has, he is basically like, ""I am the Avater I'll fix things"" which is not how the series goes. He is a 12yo kid. For those who don't remember they go run around all over the world because Aang wants to be on vacation and is afraid of being the Avatar. Oh and btw, Appa and Momo are completely irrelevant in the series and randomly appear in scenes where they need them, which makes them feel less like real characters and more like a car and pet that the series is easter egging.

Is the show bad? No. It is fun and there are some charming moments, but overall... Well... Lets maybe stop with the live action and just stick to rewatching the ATLA we grew up with.",1708909149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1b04joc/avatar_the_last_airbender_is_exceptionally/,0.29

The main problems with the movie was that it changed a lot about the original show in a nonsensical way and tried to rush so much in one film.

That's pretty much how I felt watching this show. I'm not inherently against being different from the source material, but it should be done with careful thought to how it affects the plot and character dynamics. The show skips important events which then prevents future emotional scenes from happening. If this is a series, why not take the time to do the story justice and really flesh it out? 

My positive thoughts about the show was that there were some good casting and actors, (EX: Ang and Admiral Zhao). 

Overall, I expected this show to be problematic as with a lot of Netflix adaptations and I was not wrong. 3/10 is my score ",1708885283.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1azusmq/the_issues_with_the_last_airbender_series_is/,0.36

923,1azso1a,Fool Me Once fooled me 8 times to finish watching all 8 episodes,"Fool Me Once might have been one of the worst things I've watched in years and I'm disgusted it took practically 8 hours of my weekend. Halfway in I already acknowledged it was pretty bad but I felt like I might as well finish it to the see the ending. All the red herrings and only revealing the complete picture at the very end isn't clever writing, at some point it turned super gimmicky especially when some of the plotlines weren't well connected. The whole long lost brother thing might have only been part of the plot to show how Claire investigated but it's crazy to me to think she only reached out to Louis so she could get closer to the private school. The ending of Maya sacrificing herself was surprising in the sense that I guess she just didn't give a shit about her child. I'm not quite sure why the whole show was based around every character refusing for others to help them or at least be super reluctant to receive help.


I usually can tolerate dumb stuff, for example Night Agent and the Recruit are pretty dumb in my opinion, but in a more fun and less serious way. The vibe I got from this show was it was written with the intention of trying to be smart and I just imagine the writer being smug at the end of writing it because he or she thought they were being so clever and created a Shawshank-like reveal at the end but in reality the writing was garbage. The acting wasn't great either but even if it was, it still wouldn't have offset the rest of the show's shortcomings.

930,1azldbb,Here's my honest review ATLAB,"
As a longtime Avatar fan, I dove into the new live-action series with a mix of excitement and anxiety. While it didn't quite capture the magic of the original, there were aspects I genuinely enjoyed.
One standout was the shift in Katara's storyline. Transforming her into a self-taught prodigy was a refreshing twist, showcasing her determination and inner strength. I particularly loved the scene where Zuko taunts her about finding a master and she freezes him stating that she is the master while demonstrating her mastery
The series also kept me intrigued by cleverly weaving together elements from different parts of the original narrative. This created a sense of novelty and kept me guessing what would come next.
However, certain aspects left me wanting more. The acting, while decent, felt limited by the material, falling short of the emotional depth of the animated characters. The CG, while passable, couldn't quite match the fluidity and dynamism of animation.
But the biggest letdown was the cheesiness that permeated the series. While the original had its lighthearted moments, here it felt overdone and inauthentic. This was especially true for a lot of Ang's dialogue when he was trying to be funny
I also struggled to connect with Ang. While Sokka's actor nailed the voice and mannerisms perfectly (seriously, it was perfect!), Ang's portrayal felt somewhat flat. I'm his defense I think more episodes could have allowed for deeper character development or at least sometime to adjust to him
One delightful surprise was the return of the Cabbage Guy! His brief cameo was a nostalgic nod to the original and brought a smile to my face.
However, the change to Bumi's character was upsetting. It felt unnecessary and detracted from the established dynamic between him and Aang.
Overall, my experience with the new Avatar was a mixed bag. While it had some commendable elements, it ultimately fell short of capturing the spirit and depth of the beloved animated series. But I would actually watch a season 2. I will give it a B- I'm curious to hear what other fans think! Did you enjoy the changes? What were your favorite (or least favorite) aspects?


Honorable mentions:

Did anyone else keep forgetting that Momo and Oppa our characters because I feel like the show often forgot to. lol

Im upset there's no Haru story I would have loved to see the scene where Momo is standing under the rock and the guards thinks he's earthbending


Mixing the Omashu cave, Bumi, Jet, and The Mechanist story stories while confusing at first, played off well.

I think Jet's character was pretty spot on

The guy that played Bumi looked like Bumi

I love that they threw Azula in, really nice Pre-Character development. 

Bro, the fire lord is a freaking sociopath

Wasn't feeling Iroh at the beginning but toward the end of the series he grew on me.

931,1azkujq,Avatar live action is decent,"There may be some spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched the show yet.

From what I've read I understand a lot of people's disappointments over the adaptation of a beloved series, especially for those who have watched the original show and know the details missed in this adaptation.  However there are some redeeming factors I liked that helped the show not flop unlike other live actions I know most know of... Ahem, anyways:

Here are the main concerns I'm sure others have already said:
1. The main trio have no sense of companionship, no sense of friendship and bonds formed through their journey. 
2. The pacing of each episode is definitely way too fast, having trying to fit as many arcs from the original show into just 8 hour long episodes which definitely is a disappointment to those who remember the original series.  However even if you haven't watched the original, I feel like you can sense how rushed it still is.
4. Katara not knowing how to even form a water ball into becoming a convenient master with no cintext.
5. The main trio having no emotions.  This point is particularly apparent through Sokka and Katara.  Kara's fight with Pakku should have made her angry, frustrated, annoyed.  Yet the actress's facial expressions literally don't change, no eyebrow movement, no pursed lips or gritting of teeth or anything, just some few deep breaths when her hair just suddenly becomes unbranded.
6. I get why they did it but... The way the female waterbenders joined the defense was so cringe and corny like there didn't need to be another reason for female empowerment when the kyoshi island part was what it should have been for.
7. Sokka having kissed Suki within literally 2 days of meeting each other and then Yue all so suddenly was very jarring.  Lack of context was given on transitions of their journey.

Now for the redeeming factors that I found (ironically the most good I found came from the fire nation):
1. The focus on fire nation development and internal affairs. I actually liked that there was a lot of focus on the inner goings of the fire nation since it offered up a bit more of a perspective on their characters (at least from what I remember, been a while since I watched the original series)
2. The fire nation characters had the most character development in the show (despite me not particularly liking Iroh's character here).
3. Zhao was a great villain character and despite the rushed pacing of the episodes, he actually still had a very good development throughout.
4. Fire and Air bending was portrayed the best.  Earth bending was decent and water bending was left at a disappointment.  A bending style of flow, melodic and almost effortless movements sure looked heavy with a lot of effort.
5. I'm glad there was a lot of Ozai in this show because if he was left mostly as a mysterious all powerful figure, it wouldn't have fit the compact 8 episode season.  It delved just a little into his character, and I'm glad it wasn't too much but just enough to show reason as to why he's firelord at all.

Edit: 
Overall the show was....mediocre, average at best.  The exploration of the fire nation was very well done and the CGI of the sets were beautiful.  There are many more concerns I do have that I could type out but it would already get too long, while there are a few more redeeming qualities I can mention as well such as the characters of Jet and Sai being actually faithful adaptations of the original. 

So my overall rating as a fan of the OG series would be a 4/10. 

However if I consider forgetting the OG series and thought of this show as a standalone show, it would be a 5.5/10",1708856906.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1azkujq/avatar_live_action_is_decent/,0.59

Why do they always say exactly what they mean in the most mundane obvious way possible. It is like they think the audience is stupid.

942,1az6kz0,NATLA: please listen to the fans,"&gt; It's not magic, it's airbending!

I feel a mixture of excitement and concern regarding the live-action adaptation. The world of Avatar captivated my imagination since I was a little girl. I was eager to revisit its universe, and yet, I fear that the essence of what made it so extraordinary might have been lost.

At the heart of Avatar were unforgettable characters whose complex journeys mirrored the show's thematic depth. Aang wasn't just the Avatar, but a joyful kid grappling with a world-saving destiny that seemed at odds with his nature. His struggle to balance responsibility and playfulness was a cornerstone of the series. Sadly, the remake appears to favor a more somber Aang, eroding a core aspect of who he was.

This change extends to other characters as well. Zuko's journey wasn't defined solely by capturing the Avatar, but by his grueling internal battle between restoring his honor vs other ambitions. His portrayal seems to strip away much of that appeal. Uncle Iroh, beloved for his gentle wisdom and quiet strength, deserves the same thoughtful treatment. Even Azula, one of if not *the* most charismatic antagonists in television, held a warped mirror to the pressures placed on child leaders - her complexity was as compelling as it was disturbing. To reduce these characters to simplified versions of themselves does them a great disservice. :(

A lot of the richness of the relationships within Avatar feel... diluted in this remake. Katara's maternal warmth towards Aang, her fierce protectiveness, and determination to become that master waterbender so she can be Aang's ""Sifu Katara"", were cornerstones of her personality and their budding relationship. Her connection with Sokka that was built on playful bickering, but also unwavering sibling love, was as much a source of humor as of heartfelt emotion. The remake seems to struggle to capture this dynamic adequately. Likewise, Suki's strength and capable leadership as a Kyoshi warrior feels conpletely diminished. Those interactions between her and Sokka were supposed to set the ground for a lot of future interaction between them, and also act as a catalyst for personal growth on Sokka's end.

The original show's respectful integration of Asian and Inuit influences was vital to its success. These elements weren't window dressing but skillfully woven into the world itself. They feel a bit reduced to a token-like representation in the remake.

The pacing of the animated series was essential to its impact. Moments of both levity and gravity were given space to breathe. Where's the penguin riding? Dangerous Koi taming? Katara's jealousy over other girls in the Kyoshi village fawning over Aang? It's worrisome to see a potentially rushed adaptation that risks undermining the emotional weight and world-building efforts of the original.

I understand the challenges of adapting such a beloved story, but I implore you to consider what made ATLA transcend mere entertainment. A faithful live-action adaptation could be a triumph for Netflix or any studio that takes it on. Please, reconsider the current approach. Prioritize capturing the spirit, care, and attention to detail that elevated the source material into something truly exceptional.  Fans want more than a retelling - we yearn to see a beloved world brought to life with respect and understanding.

I'll continue to have sincere hope for the future of a remake.",1708811723.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1az6kz0/natla_please_listen_to_the_fans/,0.44

The Actors are well casted, though the acting and directing is not really top notch, may be as an approach for a younger Audience.

But the biggest criticsm: It looks awefully cheap. The CGI and green screen work is really in the style of pre pandemic I can see render artefacts and lazy backgrounds everywhere. But the worst is the costumes and make-up. Like Shannara chronicles Bad, especially the water tribe.

I will continue to watch because it is really entertaining. But I don't know if it is only because of nostalgia. I like to hear different opinions on that.

The only thing that I will say is that while it *is* a romance, it is *not* a rom-com. It can be funny, though, so don't let that deter you!! It's just a more subtle, everyday life humor. But, if you want *How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days* or even *When Harry Met Sally*, watch *10 Things I Hate about You* or *Married by M!stake*. (Actually...I don't think either of those are on Netflix, so...watch *Set It Up* or *The Half of It* (fantastic movie that isn't quite a rom-com either, but is closer than *One Day*) or *Love at First Sight* (which is also not quite a rom-com but a good movie and also still closer to a rom-com than *One Day*.)

963,1aynw8a,Avatar the last airbender thoughts (spoiler free),"The bad:
- Some of the acting, especially from the younger characters, isn’t great.
- Aang is wayyyyy too serious. One of the key things about him is that he’s a goofy kid who’s burdened with a great responsibility. In this adaptation he seems like he’s all duty and no fun.
- It feels like the main trio aren’t really bonding. There’s not a lot of talk between them and it just feels off to me. 
- I think katara and sokka were probably cast well but their dialogue doesn’t really build who they are very much. They just kind of say what needs to be said to move the story along. 
- The CGI for the avatar state is horrible

The good:
- They did really well to mesh all of the plot points. Since the original was a cartoon, they could just cut to them flying at the start of every episode. But if they did that with hour long live action episodes people would be saying “wait how’d they get there?”The show has characters and events happen at times/places you wouldn’t expect, but it works well.  
- It holds true to the original and keeps the majority of your favorite moments while still being a new show. People might be upset that it’s not exactly like the original, but in truth I think it would be worse than you’d think.
- The casting is outstanding in my opinion.
- The rest of the visual effects are awesome 
- The costumes, set design, and props are freaking perfect.

Overall I’d say it’s 7/10
